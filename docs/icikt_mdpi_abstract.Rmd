**Introduction**: Almost all correlation measures currently available are unable to directly handle missing values.
Typically, missing values are either ignored completely by removing them or are imputed and used in the calculation of the correlation coefficient.
In either case, the correlation value will be impacted based on a perspective that the missing data represents no useful information.
However, missing values occur in real metabolomics data sets for a variety of reasons, but frequently due to specific measurable analytes falling below the limit-of-detection of the analytical instrumentation (left-censored values).
These missing data are not missing at random, but represent useful information by virtue of their "missingness" at one end of the data distribution.

**Methods**: To include this information due to left-censorship missingness, we propose the information-content-informed Kendall-tau (ICI-Kt) methodology.
We show how left-censored missing values can be included within the definition of the Kendall-tau correlation coefficient, and how that inclusion leads to an interpretation of information being added to the correlation.
We also implement calculations for additional measures of theoretical maxima and pairwise completeness that add further layers of information interpretation in the methodology.

**Results**: Using both simulated and real data sets from various metabolomics experiments, we demonstrate that the ICI-Kt methodology allows for the inclusion of left-censored missing data values as interpretable information, enabling both improved determination of outlier samples and improved feature-feature network construction.
We provide explicitly parallel implementations in both R and Python packages that allow fast calculations of all the variables used when applying the ICI-Kt methodology on large numbers of samples.
