		"abstract": "In 1885, Sir Francis Galton first defined the term “regression” and completed the theory of bivariate correlation. A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.",

		"abstract": "Understanding cellular metabolic systems is vital not only for determining the function of enzymatic genes, but also for elucidating the coordination among various metabolic pathways. In this context, high-throughput experiments can provide us with essential, albeit only partial information. Integration of metabolite profiling with other multiple 'omics' data (e.g. transcript profiling), is required to reconstruct complex networks that characterize the phenotypes in the cell. Here, we review recent approaches to integrate multiple omics data in higher plants. We especially focus on metabolomics data management, normalization, meta-omics data analysis, and an integrative approach with other omics data. Further prospects for using metabolomics and the key points to be addressed are discussed. This could be a valuable strategy for a systems-level understanding of plant systems.",

		"abstract": "A system-wide understanding of cellular function requires knowledge of all functional interactions between the expressed proteins. The STRING database aims to collect and integrate this information, by consolidating known and predicted protein-protein association data for a large number of organisms. The associations in STRING include direct (physical) interactions, as well as indirect (functional) interactions, as long as both are specific and biologically meaningful. Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data on protein-protein interactions, and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from the following sources: (i) systematic co-expression analysis, (ii) detection of shared selective signals across genomes, (iii) automated text-mining of the scientific literature and (iv) computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework. Further improvements include automated background analysis of user inputs for functional enrichments, and streamlined download options. The STRING resource is available online, at http://string-db.org/.",

Given a query gene list, GeneMANIA finds functionally similar genes using a wealth of genomics and proteomics data. In this mode, it weights each functional genomic dataset according to its predictive value for the query. Another use of GeneMANIA is gene function prediction. Given a single query gene, GeneMANIA finds genes likely to share function with it based on their interactions with it. Enriched Gene Ontology categories among this set can point to the function of the gene. Nine organisms are currently supported (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Hundreds of data sets and hundreds of millions of interactions have been collected from GEO, BioGRID, IRefIndex and I2D, as well as organism-specific functional genomics data sets. Users can customize their search by selecting specific data sets to query and by uploading their own data sets to analyze. We have recently updated the user interface to GeneMANIA to make it more intuitive and make more efficient use of visual space. GeneMANIA can now be used effectively on a variety of devices.",

		"abstract": "Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.",

		"abstract": "Metabolomics studies have seen a steady growth due to the development and implementation of affordable and high-quality metabolomics platforms. In large metabolite panels, measurement values are frequently missing and, if neglected or sub-optimally imputed, can cause biased study results. We provided a publicly available, user-friendly R script to streamline the imputation of missing endogenous, unannotated, and xenobiotic metabolites. We evaluated the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) analyses implemented in our script by simulations using measured metabolites data from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study (n = 599). We simulated missing values in four unique metabolites from different pathways with different correlation structures in three sample sizes (599, 150, 50) with three missing percentages (15%, 30%, 60%), and using two missing mechanisms (completely at random and not at random). Based on the simulations, we found that for MICE, larger sample size was the primary factor decreasing bias and error. For kNN, the primary factor reducing bias and error was the metabolite correlation with its predictor metabolites. MICE provided consistently higher performance measures particularly for larger datasets (n > 50). In conclusion, we presented an imputation workflow in a publicly available R script to impute untargeted metabolomics data. Our simulations provided insight into the effects of sample size, percentage missing, and correlation structure on the accuracy of the two imputation methods.",

Identifying differentially expressed genes crucially depends on estimates of read-count variability. These estimates are typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomial distribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Until now, the validity of these models has usually been tested on either low-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations.Results: A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment in yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observed gene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomial distributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constant dispersion parameter of ∼0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strict quality control and screening of ‘bad’ replicates, which can drastically affect the gene read-count distribution.Availability and implementation: RNA-seq data have been submitted to ENA archive with project ID PRJEB5348.Contact:g.j.barton@dundee.ac.uk",

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management \"Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp\" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of ManagementThe Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- Søren Højsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark \"Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp\" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++.Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematical Economics from EHESS (Paris), and works in Chicago as a Senior Quantitative Analyst.",

		"abstract": "R has always provided an application programming interface (API) for extensions. Based on the C language, it uses a number of macros and other low-level constructs to exchange data structures between the R process and any dynamically loaded component modules authors added to it. With the introduction of the Rcpp package, and its later refinements, this process has become considerably easier yet also more robust. By now, Rcpp has become the most popular extension mechanism for R. This article introduces Rcpp, and illustrates with several examples how the Rcpp Attributes mechanism in particular eases the transition of objects between R and C++ code.

		"abstract": "Background\nNetwork-based analysis of gene expression through co-expression networks can be used to investigate modular relationships occurring between genes performing different biological functions. An extended description of each of the network modules is therefore a critical step to understand the underlying processes contributing to a disease or a phenotype. Biological integration, topology study and conditions comparison (e.g. wild vs mutant) are the main methods to do so, but to date no tool combines them all into a single pipeline.\n\nResults\nHere we present GWENA, a new R package that integrates gene co-expression network construction and whole characterization of the detected modules through gene set enrichment, phenotypic association, hub genes detection, topological metric computation, and differential co-expression. To demonstrate its performance, we applied GWENA on two skeletal muscle datasets from young and old patients of GTEx study. Remarkably, we prioritized a gene whose involvement was unknown in the muscle development and growth. Moreover, new insights on the variations in patterns of co-expression were identified. The known phenomena of connectivity loss associated with aging was found coupled to a global reorganization of the relationships leading to expression of known aging related functions.\n\nConclusion\nGWENA is an R package available through Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GWENA.html) that has been developed to perform extended analysis of gene co-expression networks. Thanks to biological and topological information as well as differential co-expression, the package helps to dissect the role of genes relationships in diseases conditions or targeted phenotypes. GWENA goes beyond existing packages that perform co-expression analysis by including new tools to fully characterize modules, such as differential co-expression, additional enrichment databases, and network visualization.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12859-021-04179-4.",

		"abstract": "The accurate estimation of missing data plays a vital role in ensuring a high level of data quality. The missing values should be imputed before performing data mining, machine learning, and other data processing tasks. Ten correlation-based imputation methods are proposed in this paper. All of these methods try to maximize the correlation between a missing feature and other features. The maximization is achieved by selecting segments of data that have strong correlations. The proposed approach involves the following main steps to impute each missing instance. First, a base set is selected from complete instances. Second, data segments with strong correlations are generated using the base set and the rest of the complete instances. Finally, each missing value is imputed by applying linear models to the discovered segments of data. This study considers seven real datasets from different fields with different missing rates. The imputation quality of the proposed methods is compared to those of seven other imputation approaches in terms of three well-known evaluation criteria. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has better imputation performance than competing imputation techniques in most cases.",

		"abstract": "Error analysis plays a fundamental role in describing the uncertainty in experimental results. It has several fundamental uses in metabolomics including experimental design, quality control of experiments, the selection of appropriate statistical methods, and the determination of uncertainty in results. Furthermore, the importance of error analysis has grown with the increasing number, complexity, and heterogeneity of measurements characteristic of ‘omics research. The increase in data complexity is particularly problematic for metabolomics, which has more heterogeneity than other omics technologies due to the much wider range of molecular entities detected and measured. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of error analysis as they apply to a wide range of metabolomics experimental designs and it discusses current methodologies for determining the propagation of uncertainty in appropriate metabolomics data analysis. These methodologies include analytical derivation and approximation techniques, Monte Carlo error analysis, and error analysis in metabolic inverse problems. Current limitations of each methodology with respect to metabolomics data analysis are also discussed.",

		"abstract": "An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of 2 conditions was performed to determine the number of biological replicates ($n_r$) required, and to identify the most effective statistical analysis tools for identifying differential gene expression (DGE). When $n_r=3$, seven of the nine tools evaluated give true positive rates (TPR) of only 20 to 40 percent. For high fold-change genes ($|log_{2}(FC)|\\gt2$) the TPR is $\\gt85$ percent. Two tools performed poorly; over- or under-predicting the number of differentially expressed genes. Increasing replication gives a large increase in TPR when considering all DE genes but only a small increase for high fold-change genes. Achieving a TPR $\\gt85$% across all fold-changes requires $n_r\\gt20$. For future RNA-seq experiments these results suggest $n_r\\gt6$, rising to $n_r\\gt12$ when identifying DGE irrespective of fold-change is important. For $6 \\lt n_r \\lt 12$, superior TPR makes edgeR the leading tool tested. For $n_r \\ge12$, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq outperforms the other tools.",

Kinase Enrichment Analysis 3 (KEA3) is a webserver application that infers overrepresentation of upstream kinases whose putative substrates are in a user-inputted list of proteins. KEA3 can be applied to analyze data from phosphoproteomics and proteomics studies to predict the upstream kinases responsible for observed differential phosphorylations. The KEA3 background database contains measured and predicted kinase-substrate interactions (KSI), kinase-protein interactions (KPI), and interactions supported by co-expression and co-occurrence data. To benchmark the performance of KEA3, we examined whether KEA3 can predict the perturbed kinase from single-kinase perturbation followed by gene expression experiments, and phosphoproteomics data collected from kinase-targeting small molecules. We show that integrating KSIs and KPIs across data sources to produce a composite ranking improves the recovery of the expected kinase. The KEA3 webserver is available at https://maayanlab.cloud/kea3.",

		"abstract": "The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.",

		"abstract": "Assessment of high-throughput-omics data initially focuses on relative or raw levels of a particular feature, such as an expression value for a transcript, protein, or metabolite. At a second level, analyses of annotations including known or predicted functions and associations of each individual feature, attempt to distill biological context. Most currently available comparative- and meta-analyses methods are dependent on the availability of identical features across data sets, and concentrate on determining features that are differentially expressed across experiments, some of which may be considered \"biomarkers.\" The heterogeneity of measurement platforms and inherent variability of biological systems confounds the search for robust biomarkers indicative of a particular condition. In many instances, however, multiple data sets show involvement of common biological processes or signaling pathways, even though individual features are not commonly measured or differentially expressed between them. We developed a methodology, categoryCompare, for cross-platform and cross-sample comparison of high-throughput data at the annotation level. We assessed the utility of the approach using hypothetical data, as well as determining similarities and differences in the set of processes in two instances: (1) denervated skin vs. denervated muscle, and (2) colon from Crohn's disease vs. colon from ulcerative colitis (UC). The hypothetical data showed that in many cases comparing annotations gave superior results to comparing only at the gene level. Improved analytical results depended as well on the number of genes included in the annotation term, the amount of noise in relation to the number of genes expressing in unenriched annotation categories, and the specific method in which samples are combined. In the skin vs. muscle denervation comparison, the tissues demonstrated markedly different responses. The Crohn's vs. UC comparison showed gross similarities in inflammatory response in the two diseases, with particular processes specific to each disease.",

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

Since the introduction of the KEGG NETWORK database, various diseases have been associated with network variants, which are perturbed molecular networks caused by human gene variants, viruses, other pathogens and environmental factors. The network variation maps are created as aligned sets of related networks showing, for example, how different viruses inhibit or activate specific cellular signaling pathways. The KEGG pathway maps are now integrated with network variation maps in the NETWORK database, as well as with conserved functional units of KEGG modules and reaction modules in the MODULE database.

To extend our ability to annotate human disease processes, we have implemented a new drug class and have used it initially to annotate drugs relevant to cardiovascular disease. Our annotation model depends on external domain experts to identify new areas for annotation and to review new content. New web pages facilitate recruitment of community experts and allow those who have contributed to Reactome to identify their contributions and link them to their ORCID records.

		"abstract": "Genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all eukaryotes. Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.",

		"abstract": "The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to reﬁne GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientiﬁc articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer ﬁndings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and ﬁle structure for both the ontology and annotations.",

Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.",

		"abstract": "Dendrograms are graphical representations of binary tree structures resulting from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In Life Science, a cluster heat map is a widely accepted visualization technique that utilizes the leaf order of a dendrogram to reorder the rows and columns of the data table. The derived linear order is more meaningful than a random order, because it groups similar items together. However, two consecutive items can be quite dissimilar despite proximity in the order. In addition, there are 2 (n-1) possible orderings given n input elements as the orientation of clusters at each merge can be flipped without affecting the hierarchical structure. We present two modular leaf ordering methods to encode both the monotonic order in which clusters are merged and the nested cluster relationships more faithfully in the resulting dendrogram structure. We compare dendrogram and cluster heat map visualizations created using our heuristics to the default heuristic in R and seriation-based leaf ordering methods. We find that our methods lead to a dendrogram structure with global patterns that are easier to interpret, more legible given a limited display space, and more insightful for some cases. The implementation of methods is available as an R package, named \"dendsort\", from the CRAN package repository. Further examples, documentations, and the source code are available at [https://bitbucket.org/biovizleuven/dendsort/].",

		"abstract": "RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%–40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.",

In this study, we utilized our untargeted assignment tool Small Molecule Isotope Resolved Formula Enumerator (SMIRFE) and ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry to examine lipid profile differences between paired cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissue samples from 86 patients with suspected stage I or IIA primary NSCLC. Correlation and co-occurrence analysis revealed significant lipid profile differences between cancer and non-cancer samples. Further analysis of machine-learned lipid categories for the differentially abundant molecular formulas identified a high abundance sterol, high abundance and high m/z sphingolipid, and low abundance glycerophospholipid metabolic phenotype across the NSCLC samples. At the class level, higher abundances of sterol esters and lower abundances of cardiolipins were observed suggesting altered stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1) activity and altered human cardiolipin synthase 1 or lysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity respectively, the latter of which is known to confer apoptotic resistance. The presence of a shared metabolic phenotype across a variety of genetically distinct NSCLC subtypes suggests that this phenotype is necessary for NSCLC development and may result from multiple distinct genetic lesions. Thus, targeting the shared affected pathways may be beneficial for a variety of genetically distinct NSCLC subtypes.",

Due to common development of drug resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, third-generation inhibitors, including osimertinib and rociletinib, have been developed. A model of EGFR-driven lung cancer and a method to develop tumors of distinct epigenetic states through 3D organotypic cultures are described here. It is discovered that activation of the EGFR T790M/L858R mutation in lung epithelial cells can drive lung cancers with alveolar or bronchiolar features, which can originate from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells or bronchioalveolar stem cells, but not basal cells or club cells of the trachea. It is also demonstrated that these clones are able to retain their epigenetic differences through passaging orthotopically in mice and crucially that they have distinct drug vulnerabilities. This work serves as a blueprint for exploring how epigenetics can be used to stratify patients for precision medicine decisions.",

		"abstract": "Almost all correlation measures currently available are unable to handle missing values. Typically, missing values are either ignored completely by removing them or are imputed and used in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. In both cases, the correlation value will be impacted based on a perspective that missing data represents no useful information. However, missing values occur in real data sets for a variety of reasons. In omics data sets that are derived from analytical measurements, the primary reason for missing values is that a specific measurable phenomenon falls below the detection limits of the analytical instrumentation. These missing data are not missing at random, but represent some information by their “missingness.” Therefore, we propose an information-content-informed Kendall-tau (ICI-Kt) correlation coefficient that allows missing values to carry explicit information in the determination of concordant and discordant pairs. With both simulated and real data sets from RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that the ICI-Kt allows for the inclusion of missing data values as interpretable information. Moreover, our implementation of ICI-Kt uses a mergesort-like algorithm that provides O(nlog(n)) computational performance. Finally, we show that approximate ICI-Kt correlations can be calculated using smaller feature subsets of large data sets with significant time savings, which has practical computational value when feature sizes are very large.\nThe ICI-Kt correlation calculation is available in an R package and Python module on GitHub at https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/ICIKendallTau and https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/icikt, respectively.",

		"abstract": "The normal distribution is a common model of randomness. Unlike the uniform distribution, it proposes a most probable value which is also the mean, while other values occur with a probability that decreases in a regular way with distance from the mean. This behavior is mathematically very satisfying, and has an easily observed correspondence with many physical processes. One drawback of the normal distribution, however, is that it supplies a positive probability density to every value in the range (−∞, +∞), although the actual probability of an extreme event will be very low. In many cases, it is desired to use the normal distribution to describe the random variation of a quantity that, for physical reasons, must be strictly positive. A mathematically defensible way to preserve the main features of the normal distribution while avoiding extreme values involves the truncated normal distribution, in which the range of deﬁnition is made ﬁnite at one or both ends of the interval. It is the purpose of this report to describe the truncation process, to consider how certain basic statistical properties of the new distribution can be determined, to show how to eﬃciently sample the distribution, and how to construct an associated quadrature rule, or even a sparse grid quadrature rule for a problem with multidimensional randomness.",

Therefore, this experimental metabolomics methodology may allow the tracing of metabolic pathways starting from stable-isotope-enriched precursors, which can improve our mechanistic understanding of cellular metabolism. However, contributions to the observed intensities arising from the stable isotope's natural abundance must be subtracted (deisotoped) from the raw isotopologue peaks before interpretation. Previously posed deisotoping problems are sidestepped due to the isotopic resolution and identification of individual isotopologue peaks. This peak resolution and identification come from the very high mass resolution and accuracy of FT-ICR-MS and present an analytically solvable deisotoping problem, even in the context of stable-isotope enrichment.",

This huge increase in usable data requires software capable of correcting the large number of isotopologue peaks resulting from SIRM experiments in a timely manner. We describe the design of a new algorithm and software system capable of handling these high volumes of data, while including quality control methods for maintaining data quality. We validate this new algorithm against a previous single isotope correction algorithm in a two-step cross-validation. Next, we demonstrate the algorithm and correct for the effects of natural abundance for both 13C and 15N isotopes on a set of raw isotopologue intensities of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine derived from a 13C/15N-tracing experiment.

Among the tools used for metabolomic research, mass spectrometry is one of the most powerful tools. However, metabolomics by mass spectrometry always reveals a high number of unknown compounds which complicate in depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In principle, mass spectrometry can be utilized within strategies of de novo structure elucidation of small molecules, starting with the computation of the elemental composition of an unknown metabolite using accurate masses with errors <5 ppm (parts per million). However even with very high mass accuracy (<1 ppm) many chemically possible formulae are obtained in higher mass regions. In automatic routines an additional orthogonal filter therefore needs to be applied in order to reduce the number of potential elemental compositions. This report demonstrates the necessity of isotope abundance information by mathematical confirmation of the concept.",

In recent years, mass spectrometry has come to the forefront as a powerful biophysical method, which can shed light both on the structure and dynamics of proteins. Hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive marker of the backbone dynamics in solution that, combined with gas phase dissociation techniques, can provide a high resolution tool to locate the dynamic regions of a protein. Additionally, charge state distributions in electrospray mass spectra yield insight into the nature and population of alternate structural states present at equilibrium. In this paper, we describe several applications of these methodologies to probe the dynamic events key to the structure, folding, and biological functions of proteins.",

		"abstract": "This review presents an overview of the dynamically developing field of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Metabolomics aims at the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of wide arrays of metabolites in biological samples. These numerous analytes have very diverse physico-chemical properties and occur at different abundance levels. Consequently, comprehensive metabolomics investigations are primarily a challenge for analytical chemistry and specifically mass spectrometry has vast potential as a tool for this type of investigation. Metabolomics require special approaches for sample preparation, separation, and mass spectrometric analysis. Current examples of those approaches are described in this review. It primarily focuses on metabolic fingerprinting, a technique that analyzes all detectable analytes in a given sample with subsequent classification of samples and identification of differentially expressed metabolites, which define the sample classes. To perform this complex task, data analysis tools, metabolite libraries, and databases are required. Therefore, recent advances in metabolomics bioinformatics are also discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 26:51–78, 2007",

		"abstract": "Amino acids have crucial roles in central metabolism, both anabolic and catabolic. To elucidate these roles, steady-state concentrations of amino acids alone are insufficient, as each amino acid participates in multiple pathways and functions in a complex network, which can also be compartmentalized. Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) is an approach that uses atom-resolved tracking of metabolites through biochemical transformations in cells, tissues, or whole organisms. Using different elemental stable isotopes to label multiple metabolite precursors makes it possible to resolve simultaneously the utilization of these precursors in a single experiment. Conversely, a single precursor labeled with two (or more) different elemental isotopes can trace the allocation of e.g. C and N atoms through the network. Such dual-label experiments however challenge the resolution of conventional mass spectrometers, which must distinguish the neutron mass differences among different elemental isotopes. This requires ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS). When combined with direct infusion nano-electrospray ion source (nano-ESI), UHR-FTMS can provide rapid, global, and quantitative analysis of all possible mass isotopologues of metabolites. Unfortunately, very low mass polar metabolites such as amino acids can be difficult to analyze by current models of UHR-FTMS, plus the high salt content present in typical cell or tissue polar extracts may cause unacceptable ion suppression for sources such as nano-ESI. Here we describe a modified method of ethyl chloroformate (ECF) derivatization of amino acids to enable rapid quantitative analysis of stable isotope labeled amino acids using nano-ESI UHR-FTMS. This method showed excellent linearity with quantifiable limits in the low nanomolar range represented in microgram quantities of biological specimens, which results in extracts with total analyte abundances in the low to sub-femtomole range. We have applied this method to profile amino acids and their labeling patterns in 13C and 2H doubly labeled PC9 cell extracts, cancerous and non-cancerous tissue extracts from a lung cancer patient and their protein hydrolysates as well as plasma extracts from mice fed with a liquid diet containing 13C6-glucose (Glc). The multi-element isotopologue distributions provided key insights into amino acid metabolism and intracellular pools in human lung cancer tissues in high detail. The 13C labeling of Asp and Glu revealed de novo synthesis of these amino acids from 13C6-Glc via the Krebs cycle, specifically the elevated level of 13C3-labeled Asp and Glu in cancerous versus non-cancerous lung tissues was consistent with enhanced pyruvate carboxylation. In addition, tracking the fate of double tracers, (13C6-Glc + 2H2-Gly or 13C6-Glc + 2H3-Ser) in PC9 cells clearly resolved pools of Ser and Gly synthesized de novo from 13C6-Glc (13C3-Ser and 13C2-Gly) versus Ser and Gly derived from external sources (2H3-Ser, 2H2-Gly). Moreover the complex 2H labeling patterns of the latter were results of Ser and Gly exchange through active Ser-Gly one-carbon metabolic pathway in PC9 cells.",

Labeling of Trypanosoma brucei cell cultures with 50% uniformly 13C-labeled glucose demonstrated incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into 187 of 588 putatively identified metabolites in diverse pathways including carbohydrate, nucleotide, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Labeling patterns confirmed the metabolic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of many detected metabolites, and labeling was detected in unexpected metabolites, including two higher sugar phosphates annotated as octulose phosphate and nonulose phosphate.

While current metabolomics techniques enable high-throughput quantification of metabolites, these methods provide minimal information on the rates and connectivity of metabolic pathways. Here we present a new method, nontargeted tracer fate detection (NTFD), that expands upon the concept of metabolomics to solve the above problems. Through the combined use of stable isotope tracers and chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, our computational analysis enables the quantitative detection of all measurable metabolites derived from a specific labeled compound. Without a priori knowledge of a reaction network or compound library, NTFD provides information about relative flux magnitudes into each metabolite pool by determining the mass isotopomer distribution for all labeled compounds. This novel method adds a new dimension to the metabolomics tool box and provides a framework for global analysis of metabolic fluxes.",

		"abstract": "Advances in analytical methodologies, principally nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), during the last decade have made large-scale analysis of the human metabolome a reality. This is leading to the reawakening of the importance of metabolism in human diseases, particularly cancer. The metabolome is the functional readout of the genome, functional genome, and proteome; it is also an integral partner in molecular regulations for homeostasis. The interrogation of the metabolome, or metabolomics, is now being applied to numerous diseases, largely by metabolite profiling for biomarker discovery, but also in pharmacology and therapeutics. Recent advances in stable isotope tracer-based metabolomic approaches enable unambiguous tracking of individual atoms through compartmentalized metabolic networks directly in human subjects, which promises to decipher the complexity of the human metabolome at an unprecedented pace. This knowledge will revolutionize our understanding of complex human diseases, clinical diagnostics, as well as individualized therapeutics and drug response. In this review, we focus on the use of stable isotope tracers with metabolomics technologies for understanding metabolic network dynamics in both model systems and in clinical applications. Atom-resolved isotope tracing via the two major analytical platforms, NMR and MS, has the power to determine novel metabolic reprogramming in diseases, discover new drug targets, and facilitates ADME studies. We also illustrate new metabolic tracer-based imaging technologies, which enable direct visualization of metabolic processes in vivo. We further outline current practices and future requirements for biochemoinformatics development, which is an integral part of translating stable isotope-resolved metabolomics into clinical reality.",

Measuring isotopic enrichment in metabolites provides quantitative insights into the biosynthetic network and enables flux analysis as a function of external perturbations.

However, meaningful biochemical interpretation of the labeling data requires both quantitative analysis and complex modeling. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach that involved acquiring and modeling the timecourses of 13C isotopologue data for UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) synthesized from [U-13C]-glucose in human prostate cancer LnCaP-LN3 cells.

This capability drives the need for a continuous ion introduction for obtaining optimal isotope ratios. Here we report the simultaneous analysis of mono and dinucleotides from crude polar extracts by FTICR-MS by adapting an ion-pairing sample preparation method for LC–MS analysis. This involves a rapid cleanup of extracted nucleotides on pipet tips containing a C18 stationary phase, which enabled global analysis of nucleotides and their 13C isotopologues at nanomolar concentrations by direct infusion nanoelectrospray FTICR-MS with 5 min of data acquisition. The resolution and mass accuracy enabled computer-assisted unambiguous assignment of most nucleotide species, including all phosphorylated forms of the adenine, guanine, uracil and cytosine nucleotides, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, cyclic nucleotides, several UDP-hexoses, and all their 13C isotopologues. The method was applied to a SIRM study on human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells grown in [U-13C] glucose with or without the anti-cancer agent methylseleninic acid. At m/z resolving power of 400,000, 13C-isotopologues of nucleotides were fully resolved from all other elemental isotopologues, thus allowing their 13C fractional enrichment to be accurately determined. The method achieves both high sample and high information throughput analysis of nucleotides for metabolic pathway reconstruction in SIRM investigations.",

It has several fundamental uses in metabolomics including experimental design, quality control of experiments, the selection of appropriate statistical methods, and the determination of uncertainty in results. Furthermore, the importance of error analysis has grown with the increasing number, complexity, and heterogeneity of measurements characteristic of ‘omics research. The increase in data complexity is particularly problematic for metabolomics, which has more heterogeneity than other omics technologies due to the much wider range of molecular entities detected and measured. This review introduces the fundamental concepts of error analysis as they apply to a wide range of metabolomics experimental designs and it discusses current methodologies for determining the propagation of uncertainty in appropriate metabolomics data analysis. These methodologies include analytical derivation and approximation techniques, Monte Carlo error analysis, and error analysis in metabolic inverse problems.

		"abstract": "The rationale of this dose matching/dose escalating study was to compare a panel of flavonoids—luteolin, resveratrol, and quercetin—against the metabolite flux-controlling properties of a synthetic targeted fatty acid synthase inhibitor drug C75 on multiple macromolecule synthesis pathways in pancreatic tumor cells using [1,2-13C2]-d-glucose as the single precursor metabolic tracer. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 0.1% DMSO (control), or 50 or 100 μM of each test compound, while intracellular glycogen, RNA ribose, palmitate and cholesterol as well as extra cellular 13CO2, lactate and glutamate production patterns were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling (SiDMAP). The use of 50% [1,2-13C2]-d-glucose as tracer resulted in an average of 24 excess 13CO2 molecules for each 1,000 CO2 molecule in the culture media, which was decreased by 29 and 33% (P < 0.01) with 100 μM C75 and luteolin treatments, respectively. Extracellular tracer glucose-derived 13C-labeled lactate fractions (Σm) were between 45.52 and 47.49% in all cultures with a molar ratio of 2.47% M + 1/Σm lactate produced indirectly by direct oxidation of glucose in the pentose cycle in control cultures; treatment with 100 μM C75 and luteolin decreased this figure to 1.80 and 1.67%. The tracer glucose-derived 13C labeled fraction (Σm) of ribonucleotide ribose was 34.73% in controls, which was decreased to 20.58 and 8.45% with C75, 16.15 and 6.86% with luteolin, 27.66 and 19.25% with resveratrol, and 30.09 and 25.67% with quercetin, respectively. Luteolin effectively decreased nucleotide precursor synthesis pentose cycle flux primarily via the oxidative branch, where we observed a 41.74% flux (M + 1/Σm) in control cells, in comparison with only a 37.19%, 32.74%, or a 26.57%, 25.47% M + 1/Σm flux (P < 0.001) after 50 or 100 μM C75 or luteolin treatment. Intracellular de novo fatty acid palmitate (C16:0) synthesis was severely and equally blocked by C75 and luteolin treatments indicated by the 5.49% (control), 2.29 or 2.47% (C75) and 2.21 or 2.73% (luteolin) tracer glucose-derived 13C-labeled fractions, respectively. On the other hand there was a significant 192 and 159% (P < 0.001), and a 103 and 117% (P < 0.01) increase in tracer glucose-derived cholesterol after C75 or luteolin treatment. Only resveratrol and quercetin at 100 μM inhibited tracer glucose-derived glycogen labeling (Σm) and turnover by 34.8 and 23.8%, respectively. The flavonoid luteolin possesses equal efficacy to inhibit fatty acid palmitate de novo synthesis as well as nucleotide RNA ribose turnover via the oxidative branch of the pentose cycle in comparison with the targeted fatty acid synthase inhibitor synthetic compound C75. Luteolin is also effective in stringently controlling glucose entry and anaplerosis in the TCA cycle, while it promotes less glucose flux towards cholesterol synthesis than that of C75. In contrast, quercetin and resveratrol inhibit glycogen synthesis and turnover as their underlying mechanism of controlling tumor cell proliferation. Therefore the flavonoid luteolin controls fatty and nucleic acid syntheses as well as energy production with pharmacological strength, which can be explored as a non-toxic natural treatment modality for pancreatic cancer.",

		"abstract": "Improvements in Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) enable increasingly more complex experiments in the field of metabolomics. What is directly detected in FT-MS spectra are spectral features (peaks) that correspond to sets of adducted and charged forms of specific molecules in the sample. The robust assignment of these features is an essential step for MS-based metabolomics experiments, but the sheer complexity of what is detected and a variety of analytically introduced variance, errors, and artifacts has hindered the systematic analysis of complex patterns of observed peaks with respect to isotope content. We have developed a method called SMIRFE that detects small biomolecules and determines their elemental molecular formula (EMF) using detected sets of isotopologue peaks sharing the same EMF. SMIRFE does not use a database of known metabolite formulas; instead a nearly comprehensive search space of all isotopologues within a mass range is constructed and used for assignment. This search space can be tailored for different isotope labeling patterns expected in different stable isotope tracing experiments. Using consumer-level computing equipment, a large search space of 2000 Da was constructed, and assignment performance was evaluated and validated using verified assignments on a pair of peak lists derived from spectra containing unlabeled and 15N-labeled versions of amino acids derivatized using ethylchloroformate. SMIRFE identified 18 of 18 predicted derivatized EMFs, and each assignment was evaluated statistically and assigned an e-value representing the probability to occur by chance.",

		"abstract": "Despite instrument and algorithmic improvements, the untargeted and accurate assignment of metabolites remains an unsolved problem in metabolomics. New assignment methods such as our SMIRFE algorithm can assign elemental molecular formulas to observed spectral features in a highly untargeted manner without orthogonal information from tandem MS or chromatography. However, for many lipidomics applications, it is necessary to know at least the lipid category or class that is associated with a detected spectral feature to derive a biochemical interpretation. Our goal is to develop a method for robustly classifying elemental molecular formula assignments into lipid categories for an application to SMIRFE-generated assignments. Using a Random Forest machine learning approach, we developed a method that can predict lipid category and class from SMIRFE non-adducted molecular formula assignments. Our methods achieve high average predictive accuracy (>90%) and precision (>83%) across all eight of the lipid categories in the LIPIDMAPS database. Classification performance was evaluated using sets of theoretical, data-derived, and artifactual molecular formulas. Our methods enable the lipid classification of non-adducted molecular formula assignments generated by SMIRFE without orthogonal information, facilitating the biochemical interpretation of untargeted lipidomics experiments. This lipid classification appears insufficient for validating single-spectrum assignments, but could be useful in cross-spectrum assignment validation.",

		"abstract": "Stable isotope labeling techniques have been widely applied in the field of metabolomics and proteomics. Before the measured mass spectral data can be used for quantitative analysis, it must be accurately corrected for isotope natural abundance and tracer isotopic impurity. Despite the increasing popularity of dual-isotope tracing strategy such as 13C-15N or 13C-2H, there are no accurate tools for correcting isotope natural abundance for such experiments in a resolution-dependent manner. Here, we present AccuCor2 as an R-based tool to perform the correction for 13C-15N or 13C-2H labeling experiments. Our method uses a newly designed algorithm to construct the correction matrices that link labeling pattern and measured mass fractions, then use non-negative least-squares to solve the labeling patterns. Our results show that the dual-isotope experiments often require a mass resolution that is high enough to resolve 13C and 15N or 13C and 2H. Otherwise, the labeling pattern is not solvable. However, this mass resolution may not be sufficiently high to resolve other non-tracer elements such as oxygen or sulfur from the tracer elements. Therefore, we design AccuCor2 to perform the correction based on the actual mass resolution of the measurements. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that AccuCor2 performs accurate and resolution-dependent correction for dual-isotope tracer data.",

Since assumptions of model correctness can seriously compromise interpretation of metabolic flux results, we have developed a metabolic modeling software package specifically designed for moiety model comparison and selection based on the metabolomics data provided. Here, we tested the effectiveness of model selection with two time-series mass spectrometry (MS) isotopologue datasets for uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) generated from different platforms utilizing direct infusion nanoelectrospray and liquid chromatography. Analysis results demonstrate the robustness of our model selection methods by the successful selection of the optimal model from over 40 models provided. Moreover, the effects of specific optimization methods, degree of optimization, selection criteria, and specific objective functions on model selection are illustrated. Overall, these results indicate that over-optimization can lead to model selection failure, but combining multiple datasets can help control this overfitting effect. The implication is that SIRM datasets in public repositories of reasonable quality can be combined with newly acquired datasets to improve model selection. Furthermore, curation efforts of public metabolomics repositories to maintain high data quality could have a huge impact on future metabolic modeling efforts.",

		"abstract": "Almost all correlation measures currently available are unable to handle missing values. Typically, missing values are either ignored completely by removing them or are imputed and used in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. In both cases, the correlation value will be impacted based on a perspective that missing data represents no useful information. However, missing values occur in real data sets for a variety of reasons. In omics data sets that are derived from analytical measurements, the primary reason for missing values is that a specific measurable phenomenon falls below the detection limits of the analytical instrumentation. These missing data are not missing at random, but represent some information by their “missingness.” Therefore, we propose an information-content-informed Kendall-tau (ICI-Kt) correlation coefficient that allows missing values to carry explicit information in the determination of concordant and discordant pairs. With both simulated and real data sets from RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that the ICI-Kt allows for the inclusion of missing data values as interpretable information. Moreover, our implementation of ICI-Kt uses a mergesort-like algorithm that provides O(nlog(n)) computational performance. Finally, we show that approximate ICI-Kt correlations can be calculated using smaller feature subsets of large data sets with significant time savings, which has practical computational value when feature sizes are very large.\nThe ICI-Kt correlation calculation is available in an R package and Python module on GitHub at https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/ICIKendallTau and https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/icikt, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Volcano plots are used to select the most interesting discoveries when too many discoveries remain after application of Benjamini–Hochberg’s procedure (BH). The volcano plot suggests a double filtering procedure that selects features with both small adjusted $P$-value and large estimated effect size. Despite its popularity, this type of selection overlooks the fact that BH does not guarantee error control over filtered subsets of discoveries. Therefore the selected subset of features may include an inflated number of false discoveries.In this paper, we illustrate the substantially inflated type I error rate of volcano plot selection with simulation experiments and RNA-seq data. In particular, we show that the feature with the largest estimated effect is a very likely false positive result. Next, we investigate two alternative approaches for multiple testing with double filtering that do not inflate the false discovery rate. Our procedure is implemented in an interactive web application and is publicly available.",

		"abstract": "High-throughput technologies are widely used, for example to assay genetic variants, gene and protein expression, and epigenetic modifications. One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects, which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions, reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address. We review experimental and computational approaches for doing so.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Motivation: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein–protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score.\n            Results: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein–protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53%) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.\n            Availability: The methods presented in this paper are implemented in the Cytoscape software package which is available to the academic community at http://www.cytoscape.org.\n            Contact: trey@wi.mit.edu\n            Keywords: molecular interactions; gene expression; data integration; simulated annealing; Monte carlo methods.\n            *To whom correspondence should be addressed.",

		"abstract": "The advent of microarray technology has made it possible to classify disease states based on gene expression profiles of patients. Typically, marker genes are selected by measuring the power of their expression profiles to discriminate among patients of different disease states. However, expression-based classification can be challenging in complex diseases due to factors such as cellular heterogeneity within a tissue sample and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for coping with these challenges is to incorporate pathway information into the disease classification procedure in order to classify disease based on the activity of entire signaling pathways or protein complexes rather than on the expression levels of individual genes or proteins. We propose a new classification method based on pathway activities inferred for each patient. For each pathway, an activity level is summarized from the gene expression levels of its condition-responsive genes (CORGs), defined as the subset of genes in the pathway whose combined expression delivers optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype. We show that classifiers using pathway activity achieve better performance than classifiers based on individual gene expression, for both simple and complex case-control studies including differentiation of perturbed from non-perturbed cells and subtyping of several different kinds of cancer. Moreover, the new method outperforms several previous approaches that use a static (i.e., non-conditional) definition of pathways. Within a pathway, the identified CORGs may facilitate the development of better diagnostic markers and the discovery of core alterations in human disease.",

		"abstract": "Gene Ontology is used extensively in scientific knowledgebases and repositories to organize a wealth of biological information. However, interpreting annotations derived from differential gene lists is often difficult without manually sorting into higher-order categories. To address these issues, we present GOcats, a novel tool that organizes the Gene Ontology (GO) into subgraphs representing user-defined concepts, while ensuring that all appropriate relations are congruent with respect to scoping semantics. We tested GOcats performance using subcellular location categories to mine annotations from GO-utilizing knowledgebases and evaluated their accuracy against immunohistochemistry datasets in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In comparison to term categorizations generated from UniProt’s controlled vocabulary and from GO slims via OWLTools’ Map2Slim, GOcats outperformed these methods in its ability to mimic human-categorized GO term sets. Unlike the other methods, GOcats relies only on an input of basic keywords from the user (e.g. biologist), not a manually compiled or static set of top-level GO terms. Additionally, by identifying and properly defining relations with respect to semantic scope, GOcats can utilize the traditionally problematic relation, has_part, without encountering erroneous term mapping. We applied GOcats in the comparison of HPA-sourced knowledgebase annotations to experimentally-derived annotations provided by HPA directly. During the comparison, GOcats improved correspondence between the annotation sources by adjusting semantic granularity. GOcats enables the creation of custom, GO slim-like filters to map fine-grained gene annotations from gene annotation files to general subcellular compartments without needing to hand-select a set of GO terms for categorization. Moreover, GOcats can customize the level of semantic specificity for annotation categories. Furthermore, GOcats enables a safe and more comprehensive semantic scoping utilization of go-core, allowing for a more complete utilization of information available in GO. Together, these improvements can impact a variety of GO knowledgebase data mining use-cases as well as knowledgebase curation and quality control.",

The primary goals of PROCEED are to define disease progression, test the predictive capability of candidate biomarkers, and develop a platform to conduct translational and mechanistic studies in CP. Using objective and consensus-driven criteria, PROCEED will enroll adults at different stages of CP—controls, suspected CP, and definite CP. In addition to collecting detailed information using structured case report forms and protocol-mandated evaluations at baseline and during follow-up, PROCEED will establish a linked biorepository of blood, urine, saliva, stool, pancreatic fluid, and pancreatic tissue. Enrollment for PROCEED began in June 2017. As of July 1, 2018, nine clinical centers of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer are enrolling, and 350 subjects have completed baseline evaluation. In conclusion, PROCEED will provide the most accurate and reliable estimates to date on progression of CP. The established cohort and biorepository will facilitate numerous analyses, leading to new strategies for diagnosis, methods to monitor disease progression, and treatment of CP.",

Moreover, our method calculates both peak- and scan-specific statistics incorporated within a series of quality control steps that are designed to robustly derive peak centers, intensities, and intensity ratios with their scan-level variances.

However, this process can be challenging due to the high frequency of zero counts in microbiome data. We propose a novel reference-based normalization method called normalization via rank similarity (RSim) that corrects sample-specific biases, even in the presence of many zero counts. Unlike other normalization methods, RSim does not require additional assumptions or treatments for the high prevalence of zero counts. This makes it robust and minimizes potential bias resulting from procedures that address zero counts, such as pseudo-counts. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that RSim reduces false discoveries, improves detection power, and reveals true biological signals in downstream tasks such as PCoA plotting, association analysis, and differential abundance analysis.",

For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a limma -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.",

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained for each sample. Metabolites were identified and quantified in each spectrum; resulting concentrations were normalized to account for differences in dilution among samples. Kruskal-Wallis test, post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests, and principal component analysis were performed to identify metabolites that discriminate healthy controls, acute pancreatitis, and chronic pancreatitis.ResultsSixty metabolites were identified and quantified; five were found to differ significantly (P&lt;0.05) among the three groups. Of these, citrate and adenosine remained significant after validation by random permutation. Principal component analysis demonstrated that healthy control urine samples can be differentiated from patients with chronic pancreatitis or acute pancreatitis; chronic pancreatitis patients could not be distinguished from acute pancreatitis patients.ConclusionsThis metabolomic investigation demonstrates that this non-invasive technique offers insight into the metabolic states of pancreatitis. Although the identified metabolites cannot conclusively be defined as biomarkers of disease, future studies will validate our findings in larger patient cohorts.",

Here we show that this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications of scientific results. Specifically, we present three pre-registered, randomized experiments where participants saw the same scientific findings visualized as showing only inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both, and answered questions about the size and importance of findings they were shown. Our results, comprised of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts. In contrast, we find that depicting both inferential uncertainty and outcome variability leads to more accurate perceptions of results while appearing to leave other subjective impressions of the results unchanged, on average.",

		"abstract": "Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, Springer Nature, Wiley, and SAGE: Many researchers know that the five giant firms publish most of the world’s scholarship. Fifty years of acquisitions and journal launches have yielded a stunningly profitable oligopoly, built up from academics’ unpaid writing-and-editing labor. Their business is a form of IP rentiership—collections of title-by-title prestige monopolies that, in the case of Nature or The Lancet, underwrite a stable of spinoff journals on the logic of the Hollywood franchise. Less well-known is that Elsevier and its peers are layering a second business on top of their legacy publishing operations, fueled by data extraction. They are packaging researcher behavior, gleaned from their digital platforms, into prediction products, which they sell back to universities and other clients. Their raw material is scholars’ citations, abstracts, downloads, and reading habits, repurposed into dashboard services that, for example, track researcher productivity. Elsevier and the other oligopolist firms are fast becoming, in other words, surveillance publishers . And they are using the windfall profits from their existing APC-and-subscription business to finance their moves into predictive analytics.",

		"abstract": "Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional role of lncRNAs in AD remains unclear. Here, we report a crucial role for the lncRNA Neat1 in astrocyte dysfunction and memory deficits associated with AD. Transcriptomics analysis show abnormally high expression levels of NEAT1 in the brains of AD patients relative to aged-matched healthy controls, with the most significantly elevated levels in glial cells. In a human transgenic APP-J20 (J20) mouse model of AD, RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization characterization of Neat1 expression in hippocampal astrocyte versus non-astrocyte cell populations revealed a significant increase in Neat1 expression in astrocytes of male, but not female, mice. This corresponded with increased seizure susceptibility in J20 male mice. Interestingly, Neat1 deficiency in the dCA1 in J20 male mice did not alter seizure threshold. Mechanistically, Neat1 deficiency in the dorsal area CA1 of the hippocampus (dCA1) J20 male mice significantly improved hippocampus-dependent memory. Neat1 deficiency also remarkably reduced astrocyte reactivity markers suggesting that Neat1 overexpression is associated with astrocyte dysfunction induced by hAPP/Aβ in the J20 mice. Together, these findings indicate that abnormal Neat1 overexpression may contribute to memory deficits in the J20 AD model not through altered neuronal activity, but through astrocyte dysfunction.",

To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic variants, we obtained whole genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 primate species, and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants with orthologs in human. We show that these variants can be inferred to have non-deleterious effects in human based on their presence at high allele frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6% of all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the pathogenicity of the remaining 94% of variants with deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with genetic diseases.",

We argue that instructors need to teach multiple data representation methods so that all students can produce data products that are more accessible. In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data science instructors.",

		"abstract": "Background: Site specificity is known in neuropsychiatric disorders, and differences in gene expression patterns could potentially explain this mechanism. However, studies using long-read transcriptome sequencing to analyze gene expression in different regions of the human brain have been limited, and none have focused on the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in regulating autonomic functions. Results: We performed long-read RNA sequencing on 12 samples derived from three different brain regions of the same individuals; the cerebellum, hypothalamus, and temporal cortex. We found that, compared to other regions, many genes with higher expression levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex were associated with neuronal pathways, whereas those with higher expression levels in the hypothalamus were primarily linked to immune pathways. In addition, we investigated genes with different major isoforms in each brain region, even with similar overall expression levels among regions, and identified several genes, such as GAS7, that express different major isoforms in different regions. Many of these genes are involved in \"actin filament-based process\" and \"cell projection organization\" pathways, suggesting that region-dependent isoforms may have distinct roles in dendritic spine and neuronal formation in each region. Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of DNA methylation in these isoforms and found that DNA methylation may be associated with isoforms that have different first exons. Conclusions: Our results provide potentially valuable findings for future research on brain disorders and shed light on the mechanisms underlying isoform diversity in the human brain. Keywords: long-read transcriptome sequencing, hypothalamus, DNA methylation",

		"abstract": "Cancer continues to remain a “Black Box” as there is no consensus on how it initiates, progresses, metastasizes, or recurs. Many imponderables exist about whether somatic mutations initiate cancer, do cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist, and if yes, are they a result of de-differentiation or originate from tissue-resident stem cells; why do cancer cells express embryonic markers, and what leads to metastasis and recurrence. Currently, the detection of multiple solid cancers through liquid biopsy is based on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or clusters, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). However, quantity of starting material is usually adequate only when the tumor has grown beyond a certain size. We posit that pluripotent, endogenous, tissue-resident, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) that exist in small numbers in all adult tissues, exit from their quiescent state due to epigenetic changes in response to various insults and transform into CSCs to initiate cancer. VSELs and CSCs share properties like quiescence, pluripotency, self-renewal, immortality, plasticity, enrichment in side-population, mobilization, and resistance to oncotherapy. HrC test, developed by Epigeneres, offers the potential for early detection of cancer using a common set of VSEL/CSC specific bio-markers in peripheral blood. In addition, NGS studies on VSELs/CSCs/tissue-specific progenitors using the All Organ Biopsy (AOB) test provide exomic and transcriptomic information regarding impacted organ(s), cancer type/subtype, germline/somatic mutations, altered gene expressions, and dysregulated pathways. To conclude, HrC and AOB tests can confirm the absence of cancer and categorize the rest of subjects into low/moderate/high risk of cancer, and also monitor response to therapy, remission, and recurrence.",

		"abstract": "Atomistic resolution is considered the standard for high-resolution biomolecular structures, but coarse-grained models are often necessary to reflect limited experimental resolution or to achieve feasibility in computational studies. It is generally assumed that reduced representations involve a loss of detail, accuracy, and transferability. This study explores the use of advanced machine-learning networks to learn from known structures of proteins how to reconstruct atomistic models from reduced representations to assess how much information is lost when the vast knowledge about protein structures is taken into account. The main finding is that highly accurate and stereochemically realistic all-atom structures can be recovered with minimal loss of information from just a single bead per amino acid residue, especially when placed at the side chain center of mass. High-accuracy reconstructions with better than 1 Angstrom heavy atom root-mean square deviations are still possible when only C alpha coordinates are used as input. This suggests that lower-resolution representations are essentially sufficient to represent protein structures when combined with a machine-learning framework that encodes knowledge from known structures. Practical applications of this high-accuracy reconstruction scheme are illustrated for adding atomistic detail to low-resolution structures from experiment or coarse-grained models generated from computational modeling. Moreover, a rapid, deterministic all-atom reconstruction scheme allows the implementation of an efficient multi-scale framework. As a demonstration, the rapid refinement of accurate models against cryoEM densities is shown where sampling at the coarse-grained level is guided by map correlation functions applied at the atomistic level. With this approach, the accuracy of standard all-atom simulation based refinement schemes can be matched at a fraction of the computational cost.",

METHODS We conducted a CSF proteome-wide analysis among participants of varying AT pathology (n = 137 participants; 915 proteins) with nine CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. RESULTS We identified 61 proteins significantly associated with the AT category (P < 5.46 × 10−5) and 636 significant protein-biomarker associations (P < 6.07 × 10−6). Proteins from glucose and carbon metabolism pathways were enriched among amyloid- and tau-associated proteins, including malate dehydrogenase and aldolase A, whose associations with tau were replicated in an independent cohort (n = 717). CSF metabolomics identified and replicated an association of succinylcarnitine with phosphorylated tau and other biomarkers. DISCUSSION These results implicate glucose and carbon metabolic dysregulation and increased CSF succinylcarnitine levels with amyloid and tau pathology in AD. HIGHLIGHTS Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome enriched for extracellular, neuronal, immune, and protein processing. Glucose/carbon metabolic pathways enriched among amyloid/tau-associated proteins. Key glucose/carbon metabolism protein associations independently replicated. CSF proteome outperformed other omics data in predicting amyloid/tau positivity.

		"abstract": "The root causes of dementia are still largely unclear, and the medical community lacks highly effective preventive and therapeutic pharmaceutical agents for dementia despite large investments into their development. There is growing interest in the question if infectious agents play a role in the development of dementia, with herpesviruses attracting particular attention. To provide causal as opposed to merely correlational evidence on this question, we take advantage of the fact that in Wales eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) for shingles prevention was determined based on an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before September 2 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, while those born on or after September 2 1933 were eligible to receive the vaccine. By using country-wide data on all vaccinations received, primary and secondary care encounters, death certificates, and patients’ date of birth in weeks, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely one week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just one week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine, there is no plausible reason why those born just one week prior to September 2 1933 should differ systematically from those born one week later. We demonstrate this empirically by showing that there were no systematic differences (e.g., in pre-existing conditions or uptake of other preventive interventions) between adults across the date-of-birth eligibility cutoff, and that there were no other interventions that used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility cutoff as was used for the herpes zoster vaccine program. This unique natural randomization, thus, allows for robust causal, rather than correlational, effect estimation. We first replicate the vaccine’s known effect from clinical trials of reducing the occurrence of shingles. We then show that receiving the herpes zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of seven years by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 0.6 – 7.1, p=0.019), corresponding to a 19.9% relative reduction in the occurrence of dementia. Besides preventing shingles and dementia, the herpes zoster vaccine had no effects on any other common causes of morbidity and mortality. In exploratory analyses, we find that the protective effects from the vaccine for dementia are far stronger among women than men. Randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal population groups and time interval for administration of the herpes zoster vaccine to prevent or delay dementia, as well as to quantify the magnitude of the causal effect when more precise measures of cognition are used. Our findings strongly suggest an important role of the varicella zoster virus in the etiology of dementia.",

		"abstract": "The corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the resulting long-term neurological complications in patients, known as long COVID, have renewed the interest in the correlation between viral infections and neurodegenerative brain disorders. While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogenous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as: APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, α2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF, and thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.",

To help generate Metabolomics Workbench depositions, we have developed the MESSES software package, implemented in the Python 3 programming language, and supported on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. MESSES helps transform tabular data from multiple sources into a Metabolomics Workbench specific deposition format. The package provides three commands, extract, validate, and convert, that implement a natural data transformation workflow. Moreover, MESSES facilitates richer metadata capture than is typically attempted by manual efforts.

While PFAS have been commercially produced since the 1940s, their toxicity was not publicly established until the late 1990s. The objective of this paper is to evaluate industry documents on PFAS and compare them to the public health literature in order to understand this consequential delay.\nMethods: We reviewed a collection of previously secret industry documents archived at the UCSF Chemical Industry Documents Library, examining whether and how strategies of corporate manipulation of science were used by manufacturers of PFAS. Using well-established methods of document analysis, we developed deductive codes to assess industry influence on the conduct and publication of research. We also conducted a literature review using standard search strategies to establish when scientific information on the health effects of PFAS became public.\nResults: Our review of industry documents shows that companies knew PFAS was &ldquo;highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested&rdquo; by 1970, forty years before the public health community. Further, the industry used several strategies that have been shown common to tobacco, pharmaceutical and other industries to influence science and regulation &ndash; most notably, suppressing unfavorable research and distorting public discourse. We did not find evidence in this archive of funding favorable research or targeted dissemination of those results.\nConclusions: The lack of transparency in industry-driven research on industrial chemicals has significant legal, political and public health consequences. Industry strategies to suppress scientific research findings or early warnings about the hazards of industrial chemicals can be analyzed and exposed, in order to guide prevention.",

		"abstract": "High-dimensional omics datasets frequently contain missing data points, which typically occur due to concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) of the profiling platform. The presence of such missing values significantly limits downstream statistical analysis and result interpretation. Two common techniques to deal with this issue include the removal of samples with missing values and imputation approaches that substitute the missing measurements with reasonable estimates. Both approaches, however, suffer from various shortcomings and pitfalls. In this paper, we present “rox”, a novel statistical model for the analysis of omics data with missing values without the need for imputation. The model directly incorporates missing values as “low” concentrations into the calculation. We show the superiority of rox over common approaches on simulated data and on six metabolomics datasets. Fully leveraging the information contained in LOD-based missing values, rox provides a powerful tool for the statistical analysis of omics data.",

		"abstract": "Correlation coefficients are abundantly used in the life sciences. Their use can be limited to simple exploratory analysis or to construct association networks for visualization but they are also basic ingredients for sophisticated multivariate data analysis methods. It is therefore important to have reliable estimates for correlation coefficients. In modern life sciences, comprehensive measurement techniques are used to measure metabolites, proteins, gene-expressions and other types of data. All these measurement techniques have errors. Whereas in the old days, with simple measurements, the errors were also simple, that is not the case anymore. Errors are heterogeneous, non-constant and not independent. This hampers the quality of the estimated correlation coefficients seriously. We will discuss the different types of errors as present in modern comprehensive life science data and show with theory, simulations and real-life data how these affect the correlation coefficients. We will briefly discuss ways to improve the estimation of such coefficients.",

		"abstract": "Many initiatives to improve reproducibility incentivise replication and encourage greater transparency without directly addressing the underlying skills needed for transparent and reproducible data preparation and analysis. In this paper, we argue that training in data processing and transformation should be embedded in field-specific research methods curricula. Promoting reproducibility and open science requires not only teaching relevant values and practices, but also providing the skills needed for reproducible data analysis. Improving students’ data skills will also enhance their employability within and beyond the academic context. To demonstrate the necessity of these skills, we walk through the analysis of realistic data from a classic paradigm in experimental psychology that is often used in teaching: the Stroop Interference Task. When starting from realistic raw data, nearly 80% of the data analytic effort for this task involves skills not commonly taught—namely, importing, manipulating, and transforming tabular data. Data processing and transformation is a large and inescapable part of data analysis, and so education should strive to make the work associated with it as efficient, transparent, and reproducible as possible. We conclude by considering the challenges of embedding computational data skills training in undergraduate programmes and offer some solutions.",

		"abstract": "Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.",

		"abstract": "Missing values are a genuine issue in label-free quantitative proteomics. Recent works have surveyed the different statistical methods to conduct imputation and have compared them on real or simulated data sets and recommended a list of missing value imputation methods for proteomics application. Although insightful, these comparisons do not account for two important facts: (i) depending on the proteomics data set, the missingness mechanism may be of different natures and (ii) each imputation method is devoted to a specific type of missingness mechanism. As a result, we believe that the question at stake is not to find the most accurate imputation method in general but instead the most appropriate one. We describe a series of comparisons that support our views: For instance, we show that a supposedly “under-performing” method (i.e., giving baseline average results), if applied at the “appropriate” time in the data-processing pipeline (before or after peptide aggregation) on a data set with the “appropriate” nature of missing values, can outperform a blindly applied, supposedly “better-performing” method (i.e., the reference method from the state-of-the-art). This leads us to formulate few practical guidelines regarding the choice and the application of an imputation method in a proteomics context.",

		"abstract": "Mass spectrometry proteomics is a powerful tool in biomedical research but its usefulness is limited by the frequent occurrence of missing values in peptides that cannot be reliably quantified (detected) for particular samples. Many analysis strategies have been proposed for missing values where the discussion often focuses on distinguishing whether values are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR).Statistical models and algorithms are proposed for estimating the detection probabilities and for evaluating how much statistical information can or cannot be recovered from the missing value pattern. The probability that an intensity is detected is shown to be accurately modeled as a logit-linear function of the underlying intensity, showing that missing value process is intermediate between MAR and censoring. The detection probability asymptotes to 100% for high intensities, showing that missing values unrelated to intensity are rare. The rule applies globally to each dataset and is appropriate for both high and lowly expressed peptides. A probability model is developed that allows the distribution of unobserved intensities to be inferred from the observed values. The detection probability model is incorporated into a likelihood-based approach for assessing differential expression and successfully recovers statistical power compared to omitting the missing values from the analysis. In contrast, imputation methods are shown to perform poorly, either reducing statistical power or increasing the false discovery rate to unacceptable levels.Data and code to reproduce the results shown in this article are available from https://mengbo-li.github.io/protDP/.",

		"abstract": "Protein mass spectrometry with label-free quantification (LFQ) is widely used for quantitative proteomics studies. Nevertheless, well-principled statistical inference procedures are still lacking, and most practitioners adopt methods from transcriptomics. These, however, cannot properly treat the principal complication of label-free proteomics, namely many non-randomly missing values.\nWe present proDA, a method to perform statistical tests for differential abundance of proteins. It models missing values in an intensity-dependent probabilistic manner. proDA is based on linear models and thus suitable for complex experimental designs, and boosts statistical power for small sample sizes by using variance moderation. We show that the currently widely used methods based on ad hoc imputation schemes can report excessive false positives, and that proDA not only overcomes this serious issue but also offers high sensitivity. Thus, proDA fills a crucial gap in the toolbox of quantitative proteomics.",

		"abstract": "Missing values are a notable challenge when analysing mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. While the field is still actively debating on the best practices, the challenge increased with the emergence of mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to perform imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5 main challenges linked to missing value management in single-cell proteomics. Future developments should aim to solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or data modelling. The perspective concludes with recommendations for reporting missing values, for reporting methods that deal with missing values and for proper encoding of missing values.",

In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user.

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data.

Here, we develop and evaluate a more comprehensive normalization procedure for NanoString data with steps for quality control, selection of housekeeping targets, normalization and iterative data visualization and biological validation. The approach was evaluated using a large cohort (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$N=\\kern0.5em 1649$\\end{document}) from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, two cohorts of moderate sample size (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$N=359$\\end{document} and\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$130$\\end{document}) and a small published dataset (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}$N=12$\\end{document}). The iterative process developed here eliminates technical variation (e.g. from different study phases or sites) more reliably than the three other methods, including NanoString’s commercial package, without diminishing biological variation, especially in long-term longitudinal multiphase or multisite cohorts. We also find that probe sets validated for nCounter, such as the PAM50 gene signature, are impervious to batch issues.

		"abstract": "Motivation\nIdentifying cis-acting genetic variants associated with gene expression levels—an analysis commonly referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) mapping—is an important first step toward understanding the genetic determinant of gene expression variation. Successful eQTL mapping requires effective control of confounding factors. A common method for confounding effects control in eQTL mapping studies is the probabilistic estimation of expression residual (PEER) analysis. PEER analysis extracts PEER factors to serve as surrogates for confounding factors, which is further included in the subsequent eQTL mapping analysis. However, it is computationally challenging to determine the optimal number of PEER factors used for eQTL mapping. In particular, the standard approach to determine the optimal number of PEER factors examines one number at a time and chooses a number that optimizes eQTLs discovery. Unfortunately, this standard approach involves multiple repetitive eQTL mapping procedures that are computationally expensive, restricting its use in large-scale eQTL mapping studies that being collected today.\n\nResults\nHere, we present a simple and computationally scalable alternative, Effect size Correlation for COnfounding determination (ECCO), to determine the optimal number of PEER factors used for eQTL mapping studies. Instead of performing repetitive eQTL mapping, ECCO jointly applies differential expression analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis, leading to substantial computational savings. In simulations and real data applications, we show that ECCO identifies a similar number of PEER factors required for eQTL mapping analysis as the standard approach but is two orders of magnitude faster. The computational scalability of ECCO allows for optimized eQTL discovery across 48 GTEx tissues for the first time, yielding an overall 5.89% power gain on the number of eQTL harboring genes (eGenes) discovered as compared to the previous GTEx recommendation that does not attempt to determine tissue-specific optimal number of PEER factors.\n\nAvailabilityand implementation\nOur method is implemented in the ECCO software, which, along with its GTEx mapping results, is freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html. All R scripts used in this study are also available at this site.\n\nSupplementary information\n\n are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Rats selectively bred for high running capacity (HCR) have improved metabolic health and are longer-lived than their low-capacity counterparts (LCR). Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling, we show that HCR efficiently oxidize fatty acids (FAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), sparing glycogen and reducing accumulation of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines. HCR mitochondria have reduced acetylation of mitochondrial proteins within oxidative pathways at rest, and there is rapid protein deacetylation with exercise, which is greater in HCR than LCR. Fluxomic analysis of valine degradation with exercise demonstrates a functional role of differential protein acetylation in HCR and LCR. Our data suggest that efficient FA and BCAA utilization contribute to high intrinsic exercise capacity and the health and longevity benefits associated with enhanced fitness.",

		"abstract": "Clustering nodes in a graph is a useful general technique in data mining of large network data sets. In this context, Newman and Girvan [9] recently proposed an objective function for graph clustering called the Q function which allows automatic selection of the number of clusters. Empirically, higher values of the Q function have been shown to correlate well with good graph clusterings. In this paper we show how optimizing the Q function can be reformulated as a spectral relaxation problem and propose two new spectral clustering algorithms that seek to maximize Q. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithms are eﬃcient and eﬀective at ﬁnding both good clusterings and the appropriate number of clusters across a variety of real-world graph data sets. In addition, the spectral algorithms are much faster for large sparse graphs, scaling roughly linearly with the number of nodes n in the graph, compared to O(n2) for previous clustering algorithms using the Q function.",

However, DNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that's easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distribution datasets.It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also excels in the few-shot setting, where labeled data are too scarce to train DNNs effectively.",

Impaired microglial phagocytosis is one of the main proposed outcomes by which these AD-risk genes may contribute to neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms translating genetic association to cellular dysfunction remain unknown. Here we show that microglia form lipid droplets (LDs) upon exposure to amyloid-beta (Aβ), and that their LD load increases with proximity to amyloid plaques in brains from human patients and the AD mouse model 5xFAD. LD formation is dependent upon age and disease progression and is more prominent in the hippocampus in mice and humans. Despite variability in LD load between microglia from male versus female animals and between cells from different brain regions, LD-laden microglia exhibited a deficit in Aβ phagocytosis. Unbiased lipidomic analysis identified a substantial decrease in free fatty acids (FFAs) and a parallel increase in triacylglycerols (TAGs) as the key metabolic transition underlying LD formation. We demonstrate that DGAT2, a key enzyme for the conversion of FFAs to TAGs, promotes microglial LD formation, is increased in microglia from 5xFAD and human AD brains, and that inhibiting DGAT2 improved microglial uptake of Aβ. These findings identify a new lipid-mediated mechanism underlying microglial dysfunction that could become a novel therapeutic target for AD.",

		"abstract": "The majority of immune-mediated disease (IMD) risk loci are located in non-coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to decipher their functional effects. To assess the extent to which alternative splicing contributes to IMD risk, we mapped genetic variants associated with alternative splicing (splicing quantitative trait loci or sQTL) in macrophages exposed to 24 cellular conditions. We found that genes involved in innate immune response pathways undergo extensive differential splicing in response to stimulation and detected significant sQTL effects for 5,734 genes across all conditions. We colocalised sQTL signals for over 700 genes with IMD-associated risk loci from 21 IMDs with high confidence (PP4 ≥ 0.75). Approximately half of the colocalisations implicate lowly-used splice junctions (mean usage ratio < 0.1). Finally, we demonstrate how an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk allele increases the usage of a lowly-used isoform of PTPN2, a negative regulator of inflammation. Together, our findings highlight the role alternative splicing plays in IMD risk, and suggest that lowly-used splicing events significantly contribute to complex disease risk.",

		"abstract": "Across disciplines, researchers increasingly recognize that open science and reproducible research practices may accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. While initiatives, training programs, and funder policies encourage researchers to adopt reproducible research and open science practices, these practices are uncommon in many fields. Researchers need training to integrate these practices into their daily work. We organized a virtual brainstorming event, in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, to discuss strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions. Here, we outline eleven strategies, concentrated in three areas: (1) offering training, (2) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements, and (3) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. Our goal is to encourage members of the research community to think creatively about the many ways they can contribute and collaborate to build communities, and make reproducible research and open science training the norm. Researchers may act in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees. Institutional leadership and research administration and support staff can accelerate progress by implementing change across their institutions.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggregation of proteins (amyloid beta [A] and hyperphosphorylated tau [T]) in the brain, making cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins of particular interest. METHODS We conducted a CSF proteome-wide analysis among participants of varying AT pathology (n = 137 participants; 915 proteins) with nine CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. RESULTS We identified 61 proteins significantly associated with the AT category (P < 5.46 × 10−5) and 636 significant protein-biomarker associations (P < 6.07 × 10−6). Proteins from glucose and carbon metabolism pathways were enriched among amyloid- and tau-associated proteins, including malate dehydrogenase and aldolase A, whose associations with tau were replicated in an independent cohort (n = 717). CSF metabolomics identified and replicated an association of succinylcarnitine with phosphorylated tau and other biomarkers. DISCUSSION These results implicate glucose and carbon metabolic dysregulation and increased CSF succinylcarnitine levels with amyloid and tau pathology in AD. HIGHLIGHTS Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome enriched for extracellular, neuronal, immune, and protein processing. Glucose/carbon metabolic pathways enriched among amyloid/tau-associated proteins. Key glucose/carbon metabolism protein associations independently replicated. CSF proteome outperformed other omics data in predicting amyloid/tau positivity. CSF metabolomics identified and replicated a succinylcarnitine–phosphorylated tau association.",

		"abstract": "Although there are various ways to represent data patterns and models, visualization has been primarily taught in many data science courses for its efficiency. Such vision-dependent output may cause critical barriers against those who are blind and visually impaired and people with learning disabilities. We argue that instructors need to teach multiple data representation methods so that all students can produce data products that are more accessible. In this paper, we argue that accessibility should be taught as early as the introductory course as part of the data science curriculum so that regardless of whether learners major in data science or not, they can have foundational exposure to accessibility. As data science educators who teach accessibility as part of our lower-division courses in two different institutions, we share specific examples that can be utilized by other data science instructors.",

		"abstract": "In typical single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a clustering algorithm is applied to find putative cell types as clusters, and then a statistical differential expression (DE) test is used to identify the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the cell clusters. However, this common procedure uses the same data twice, an issue known as \"double dipping\": the same data is used to define both cell clusters and DE genes, leading to false-positive DE genes even when the cell clusters are spurious. To overcome this challenge, we propose ClusterDE, a post-clustering DE test for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of identified DE genes regardless of clustering quality. The core idea of ClusterDE is to generate real-data-based synthetic null data with only one cluster, as a counterfactual in contrast to the real data, for evaluating the whole procedure of clustering followed by a DE test. Using comprehensive simulation and real data analysis, we show that ClusterDE has not only solid FDR control but also the ability to find cell-type marker genes that are biologically meaningful. ClusterDE is fast, transparent, and adaptive to a wide range of clustering algorithms and DE tests. Besides scRNA-seq data, ClusterDE is generally applicable to post-clustering DE analysis, including single-cell multi-omics data analysis.",

		"abstract": "Shotgun proteomics generates valuable information from large-scale and target protein characterizations, including protein expression, protein quantification, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein localization, and protein–protein interactions. Typically, peptides derived from proteolytic digestion, rather than intact proteins, are analyzed by mass spectrometers because peptides are more readily separated, ionized and fragmented. The amino acid sequences of peptides can be interpreted by matching the observed tandem mass spectra to theoretical spectra derived from a protein sequence database. Identified peptides serve as surrogates for their proteins and are often used to establish what proteins were present in the original mixture and to quantify protein abundance. Two major issues exist for assigning peptides to their originating protein. The first issue is maintaining a desired false discovery rate (FDR) when comparing or combining multiple large datasets generated by shotgun analysis and the second issue is properly assigning peptides to proteins when homologous proteins are present in the database. Herein we demonstrate a new computational tool, ProteinInferencer, which can be used for protein inference with both small- or large-scale data sets to produce a well-controlled protein FDR. In addition, ProteinInferencer introduces confidence scoring for individual proteins, which makes protein identifications evaluable.

		"abstract": "The many functional partnerships and interactions that occur between proteins are at the core of cellular processing and their systematic characterization helps to provide context in molecular systems biology. However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.",

		"abstract": "Academic journals have been publishing the results of biomedical research for more than 350 years. Reviewing their history reveals that the ways in which journals vet submissions have changed over time, culminating in the relatively recent appearance of the current peer-review process. Journal brand and Impact Factor have meanwhile become quality proxies that are widely used to filter articles and evaluate scientists in a hypercompetitive prestige economy. The Web created the potential for a more decoupled publishing system in which articles are initially disseminated by preprint servers and then undergo evaluation elsewhere. To build this future, we must first understand the roles journals currently play and consider what types of content screening and review are necessary and for which papers. A new, open ecosystem involving preprint servers, journals, independent content-vetting initiatives, and curation services could provide more multidimensional signals for papers and avoid the current conflation of trust, quality, and impact. Academia should strive to avoid the alternative scenario, however, in which stratified publisher silos lock in submissions and simply perpetuate this conflation.",

We describe a minor modification of eigenanalysis-based PCA in which correlations or covariances are calculated using different numbers of observations for each pair of variables, and the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to calculate component scores such that missing values are skipped. This procedure avoids artificial data imputation, exhausts all information from the data and allows the preparation of biplots for the simultaneous display of the ordination of variables and observations. The use of the modified PCA, called InDaPCA (PCA of Incomplete Data) is demonstrated on actual biological examples: leaf functional traits of plants, functional traits of invertebrates, cranial morphometry of crocodiles and fish hybridization data – with biologically meaningful results. Our study suggests that it is not the percentage of missing entries in the data matrix that matters; the success of InDaPCA is mostly affected by the minimum number of observations available for comparing a given pair of variables. In the present study, interpretation of results in the space of the first two components was not hindered, however.",

The Reactome data model allows us to represent many diverse processes in the human system, including the pathways of intermediary metabolism, regulatory pathways, and signal transduction, and high-level processes, such as the cell cycle. Reactome provides a qualitative framework, on which quantitative data can be superimposed. Tools have been developed to facilitate custom data entry and annotation by expert biologists, and to allow visualization and exploration of the finished dataset as an interactive process map. Although our primary curational domain is pathways from Homo sapiens, we regularly create electronic projections of human pathways onto other organisms via putative orthologs, thus making Reactome relevant to model organism research communities.

		"abstract": "WIMG Abstract\nSince its inception over 20 years ago, gene enrichment has been largely associated with curated gene lists (e.g. GO) that are constructed to represent various biological concepts; the cell cycle, cancer drivers, protein-protein interactions, etc. Researchers expect that a comparison of their own lab-generated lists with curated lists should produce insight. Despite the abundance of such curated lists, we here show that they rarely outperform existing individual lab-generated datasets when measured using standard statistical tests of study/study overlap. This demonstration is enabled by the WhatIsMyGene database, which we believe to be the single largest compendium of transcriptomic and micro-RNA perturbation data. The database also houses voluminous proteomic, cell type clustering, lncRNA, epitranscriptomic (etc.) data. In the case of enrichment tools that do incorporate specific lab studies in underlying databases, WIMG generally outperforms in the simple task of reflecting back to the user known aspects of the input set (cell type, the type of perturbation, species, etc.), enhancing confidence that unknown aspects of the input may also be revealed in the output. A limited number of GO lists are included in the database. However, these lists are assigned backgrounds, meaning that GO lists that are replete with abundant entities do not inordinately percolate to the highest ranking positions in output. We delineate a number of other features that should make WIMG indispensable in answering essential questions such as “What processes are embodied in my gene list?” and “What does my gene do?”",

Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

		"abstract": "We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks -- natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible \"betweenness\" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.",

However, CaMKIV is present in the cytoplasm and axons of subpopulations of neurons, including some sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), suggesting an extra-nuclear role for this protein. We observed that CaMKIV was expressed strongly in the cytoplasm and axons of a subpopulation of small diameter DRG neurons, most likely cutaneous nociceptors by virtue of their binding the isolectin IB4. In IB4+ spinal nerve axons, 20% of CaMKIV was co-localized with the endocytic marker Rab7 in axons that highly expressed CAM-Kinase-Kinase (CAMKK), an upstream activator of CaMKIV, suggesting a role for CaMKIV in signalling though signalling endosomes. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with riboprobes, we also observed that small diameter neurons expressed high levels of a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) variant of CaMK4 mRNA. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RT-PCR with gene-specific primers, and cDNA sequencing analyses we determined that the novel transcript contains an additional 10kb beyond the annotated gene terminus to a highly conserved alternate poly-adenylation site. qPCR analyses of fluorescent-activated cell sorted (FACS) DRG neurons confirmed that this 3'UTR-extended variant was preferentially expressed in IB4-binding neurons. Computational analyses of the 3'-UTR sequence predict that UTR-extension introduces consensus sites for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) including the Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV)/Hu family proteins. We consider the possible implications of axonal CaMKIV in the context of the unique properties of IB4-binding DRG neurons.",

		"abstract": "Migraine is one of the most prevalent and disabling neurological conditions, presenting episodes of throbbing headache that limit activities of daily living. Several factors may influence migraine frequency, such as lifestyle or alcohol consumption. Among the most recognised ones, sleep plays a biunivocal role, since poor sleep quality may worsen migraine frequency, and a high migraine frequency may affect sleep quality. In this paper, the authors evaluate the relationship between migraine and insomnia by exploring a cohort of patients affected by episodic or chronic migraine. To do so, a phone interview was performed, asking patients about their migraine frequency and mean pain intensity, in addition to the questions of the Insomnia Severity Index. The last one explores several symptoms impairing sleep that focus on insomnia. Patients complaining of insomnia showed an increased migraine frequency, and a weak but significant correlation was found between headache days per month and insomnia scores. Such results were particularly evident in patients affected by chronic migraine. Such results suggest how insomnia, in the presented data, seems to be associated with migraine frequency but not with pain intensity.",

		"abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and can even occur in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, which appears before Alzheimer’s disease. Sleep disorders further impair cognitive function and accelerate the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. At present, sleep disorders are considered as a risk factor for, and may be a predictor of, Alzheimer’s disease development. Given that sleep disorders are encountered in other types of dementia and psychiatric conditions, sleep-related biomarkers to predict Alzheimer’s disease need to have high specificity and sensitivity. Here, we summarize the major Alzheimer’s disease-specific sleep changes, including abnormal non-rapid eye movement sleep, sleep fragmentation, and sleep-disordered breathing, and describe their ability to predict the onset of Alzheimer’s disease at its earliest stages. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these sleep changes is also crucial if we are to clarify the role of sleep in Alzheimer’s disease. This paper therefore explores some potential mechanisms that may contribute to sleep disorders, including dysregulation of the orexinergic, glutamatergic, and γ-aminobutyric acid systems and the circadian rhythm, together with amyloid-β accumulation. This review could provide a theoretical basis for the development of drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease based on sleep disorders in future work.",

Furthermore, it is known that psychosocial features contribute to the exacerbation and chronicity of symptoms.\nObjective\nTo compare the somatosensory and psychosocial profiles of migraine patients with a control group.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the somatosensory and psychosocial profiles of patients with migraine and healthy volunteers. A total of 52 women were included. For the somatosensory profile, Mechanical Detection Threshold (MDT), Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT), Temporal Summation (TS), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) in the trigeminal and extra-trigeminal areas were evaluated. Psychosocial profiles were assessed using questionnaires, the Central Sensitization Inventory, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences in the profiles between groups. The significance level was set at 5%.\nResults\nMigraine patients showed a loss of somatosensory function in the trigeminal area for MDT (p = 0.019, r = 0.34 and p = 0.011, r = 0.37 for the ophthalmic nerve and masseter muscle respectively), lower PPT in trigeminal and extra-trigeminal areas (p < 0.001, r=>0.60) and less efficient CPM (p < 0.001, r=>0.60). No statistically significant differences were found in the TS (p=>0.05). Statistically significant differences were found in all psychosocial variables (p = <0.001 r=>0.60).\nConclusion\nMigraine patients showed loss of somatosensory function, lower pressure pain threshold, and an inhibitory pro-nociceptive profile with high scores on central sensitization and fear of movement compared to the control group.",

		"abstract": "Misprocessing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is one of the major causes of Alzheimer's disease. APP is a transmembrane protein comprising a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane helix and a short cytoplasmic tail containing an NPxY motif (normally referred to as the YENPTY motif). Talin is a synaptic scaffold protein that connects the cytoskeletal machinery to the plasma membrane via binding to one of two highly conserved NPxY motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of integrin transmembrane receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of an APP/talin complex identifying a new way to couple the cytoskeletal machinery to synaptic sites via APP. Structural modelling reveals that APP forms an extracellular meshwork that mechanically couples the cytoskeletal meshworks of both the pre-, and post-synaptic compartments. In this context, we propose APP processing as a mechanical signalling pathway with similarities to Notch signalling, whereby the cleavage sites in APP represent mechanical sensors, with varying accessibility to cleavage by secretases. During synaptogenesis in healthy neurons, the APP/talin linkage would provide an exquisite mechanical coupling between synapses, with tightly controlled APP processing providing instructions to maintain this synchrony. Furthermore, APP directly coupling to the binary switches in talin indicates a role for APP in mechanical memory storage as postulated by the MeshCODE theory. The implication that APP is a regulator of mechanical signalling leads to a new hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease, where mis-regulation of APP dynamics results in loss of mechanical integrity of the synapse, corruption and loss of mechanical binary data, and excessive generation of the toxic plaque-forming Aβ42 peptide. In support of this model, we show that talin1 depletion has a dramatic effect on APP processing in cells. Much needs to be done to experimentally validate this idea, but we present here a novel theory of Alzheimer's Disease with a role for APP in the mechanically coded binary information storage in the synapse, which identifies a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating Alzheimer's Disease.",

		"abstract": "Background Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) tools can be used to identify biological insights from transcriptional datasets and have become an integral analysis within gene expression-based cancer studies. Over the years, additional methods of GSEA-based tools have been developed, providing the field with an ever-expanding range of options to choose from. Although several studies have compared the statistical performance of these tools, the downstream biological implications that arise when choosing between the range of pairwise or single sample forms of GSEA methods remain understudied.\nMethods In this study, we compare the statistical and biological interpretation of results obtained when using a variety of pre-ranking methods and options for pairwise GSEA and fast GSEA (fGSEA), alongside single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). These analyses are applied to a well-established cohort of n=215 colon tumour samples, using the clinical feature of cancer recurrence status, non-relapse (NR) and relapse (R), as an initial exemplar, in conjunction with the Molecular Signatures Database “Hallmark” gene sets.\nResults Despite minor fluctuations in statistical performance, pairwise analysis revealed remarkably similar results when deployed using a range of gene pre-ranking methods or across a range of choices of GSEA versus fGSEA, with the same well-established prognostic signatures being consistently returned as significantly associated with relapse status. In contrast, when the same statistically significant signatures, such as Interferon Gamma Response, were assessed using ssGSEA and GSVA approaches, there was a complete absence of biological distinction between these groups (NR and R).\nConclusions Data presented here highlights how pairwise methods can overgeneralise biological enrichment within a group, assigning strong statistical significance to gene sets that may be inadvertently interpreted as equating to distinct biology. Importantly, single sample approaches allow users to clearly visualise and interpret statistical significance alongside biological distinction between samples within groups-of-interest; thus, providing a more robust and reliable basis for discovery research.",

For comparative proteomics, several methods have been used to detect the differential expression of proteins from such data. We have assessed seven methods used across the literature for detecting differential expression from spectral count quantiﬁcation: Student's t-test, signiﬁcance analysis of microarrays (SAM), normalised spectral abundance factor (NSAF), normalised spectral abundance factor-power law global error model (NSAF-PLGEM), spectral index (SpI), DESeq and QSpec. We used 2000 simulated datasets as well as publicly available data from a proteomic standards study to assess the ability of these methods to detect differential expression in varying effect sizes and proportions of differentially expressed proteins. At two false discovery rate (FDR) levels, we ﬁnd that several of the methods detect differential expression within the data with reasonable precision, others detect differential expression at the expense of low precision, and ﬁnally, others which fail to identify any differentially expressed proteins. The inability of these seven methods to fully capture the differential landscape, even at the largest effect size, illustrates some of the limitations of the existing technologies and the statistical methodologies.",

		"abstract": "The oblique random survival forest (RSF) is an ensemble supervised learning method for right-censored outcomes. Trees in the oblique RSF are grown using linear combinations of predictors, whereas in the standard RSF, a single predictor is used. Oblique RSF ensembles have high prediction accuracy, but assessing many linear combinations of predictors induces high computational overhead. In addition, few methods have been developed for estimation of variable importance (VI) with oblique RSFs. We introduce a method to increase computational efficiency of the oblique RSF and a method to estimate VI with the oblique RSF. Our computational approach uses Newton-Raphson scoring in each non-leaf node, We estimate VI by negating each coefficient used for a given predictor in linear combinations, and then computing the reduction in out-of-bag accuracy. In benchmarking experiments, we find our implementation of the oblique RSF is hundreds of times faster, with equivalent prediction accuracy, compared to existing software for oblique RSFs. We find in simulation studies that “negation VI” discriminates between relevant and irrelevant numeric predictors more accurately than permutation VI, Shapley VI, and a technique to measure VI using analysis of variance. All oblique RSF methods in the current study are available in the aorsf R package, and additional supplemental materials are available online.",

Metabolic defects are also present in AD-brain: for example, signs of deficient cerebral glucose uptake may occur decades before onset of cognitive dysfunction and tissue damage. There have been few systematic studies of the metabolite content of AD human brain, possibly due to scarcity of high-quality brain tissue and/or lack of reliable experimental methodologies. Here we sought to: 1) elucidate the molecular basis of metabolic defects in human AD-brain; and 2) identify endogenous metabolites that might guide new approaches for therapeutic intervention, diagnosis or monitoring of AD. Brains were obtained from nine cases with confirmed clinical/neuropathological AD and nine controls matched for age, sex and post-mortem delay. Metabolite levels were measured in post-mortem tissue from seven regions: three that undergo severe neuronal damage (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and middle-temporal gyrus); three less severely affected (cingulate gyrus, sensory cortex and motor cortex); and one (cerebellum) that is relatively spared. We report a total of 55 metabolites that were altered in at least one AD-brain region, with different regions showing alterations in between 16 and 33 metabolites. Overall, we detected prominent global alterations in metabolites from several pathways involved in glucose clearance/utilization, the urea cycle, and amino-acid metabolism. The finding that potentially toxigenic molecular perturbations are widespread throughout all brain regions including the cerebellum is consistent with a global brain disease process rather than a localized effect of AD on regional brain metabolism.",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans, with numbers expected to grow dramatically as the population ages. The pathophysiological changes in AD patients begin decades before the onset of dementia, highlighting the urgent need for the development of early diagnostic methods. Compelling data demonstrate that increased levels of amyloid-beta compromise multiple cellular pathways; thus, the investigation of changes in various cellular networks is essential to advance our understanding of early disease mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets. We applied a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approach to determine global metabolic changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the same individuals with different AD severity. Metabolic profiling detected a total of significantly altered 342 plasma and 351 CSF metabolites, of which 22% were identified. Based on the changes of >150 metabolites, we found 23 altered canonical pathways in plasma and 20 in CSF in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. cognitively normal (CN) individuals with a false discovery rate <0.05. The number of affected pathways increased with disease severity in both fluids. Lysine metabolism in plasma and the Krebs cycle in CSF were significantly affected in MCI vs. CN. Cholesterol and sphingolipids transport was altered in both CSF and plasma of AD vs. CN. Other 30 canonical pathways significantly disturbed in MCI and AD patients included energy metabolism, Krebs cycle, mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism, and lipid biosynthesis. Pathways in plasma that discriminated between all groups included polyamine, lysine, tryptophan metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and in CSF involved cortisone and prostaglandin 2 biosynthesis and metabolism. Our data suggest metabolomics could advance our understanding of the early disease mechanisms shared in progression from CN to MCI and to AD.",

		"abstract": "Dysfunction of the endolysosomal system within neurons is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Multiple AD-risk factors are known to cause hyper-activity of the early-endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption. APPL1, an important rab5 effector protein, is an interface between endosomal and neuronal function through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment (βCTF or C99) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endolysosomal compartments. To better understand the role of APPL1 in the AD endosomal phenotype, we generated a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1 mice). Consistent with the important endosomal regulatory role of APPL1, Thy1-APPL1 mice have enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We additionally demonstrate pathological consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), as well as degeneration of the large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and impairment of hippocampal-dependent memory. Our findings show that increased neuronal APPL1 levels lead to a cascade of pathological effects within neurons, including early endosomal alterations, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Multiple risk factors and molecular regulators, including APPL1 activity, are known to contribute to the endosomal dysregulation seen in the early stages of AD, and these findings further highlighting the shared pathobiology and consequences to a neuron of early endosomal pathway disruption.",

		"abstract": "Development from a zygote to an adult organism involves complex interactions among thousands of genes. These genes exhibit highly dynamic expression across space and time. Here we report a striking simplicity amidst this complexity: Despite individual gene expression variability, the eigengene—the principal component of gene expression—exhibits an invariant global spatial pattern throughout the embryonic and post-natal stages of the mouse brain. Furthermore, the mouse pattern is observed also in the larval zebrafish, suggesting that eigengene expression is conserved over 400 million years of evolution. We show that the eigengene pattern can be explained by a simple mitotic lineage model in which daughter cells' gene expression is similar to that of their parent, but cannot be explained by one in which gene expression arises through local cellular signaling. The constrained mitotic lineage gives rise naturally to a global eigengene expression hierarchy that could provide a bias toward the formation of its dual: a spatial hierarchy of long-range signal gradients. We propose that mitosis thus induces an address-like organization, which could have been co-opted by evolution for developmental processes that require positional information over a wide range of spatial scales, such as tissue patterning and axon navigation.",

Neurological disorders, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, are associated with physical changes, including the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau proteins, damage to the cerebral vasculature, hypertension, atrophy of the cortical gray matter, and lesions of the periventricular white matter. Alterations in the external mechanical environment of cells can trigger pathological processes, and it is known that AD causes reduced stiffness in the brain tissue during degeneration. However, there appears to be a significant lag time between microscale changes and macroscale obstruction of neurological function in the brain. Here, we present a pipeline to quantify the whole brain biomechanical environment to bridge the gap in understanding how underlying brain changes affect macroscale brain biomechanics. This pipeline enables image-based quantification of subject-specific displacement field of the whole brain to subject-specific strain, strain rate, and stress across 133 labeled functional brain regions. We have focused our development efforts on utilizing solely MRI-derived data to facilitate clinical applicability of our approach and have emphasized automation in all aspects of our methods to reduce operator dependance. Our pipeline has the potential to improve early detection of neurological disorders and facilitate the identification of disease before widespread, irreversible damage has occurred.",

Eight years of experience has shown us that the choice to run the journal as we would an open-source software project has led to successful publications (~2500 papers), a growing community (~80 editors and ~3500 reviewers), and an organization that can publish papers at about $2.00/per paper because of the generous volunteer community, and the fact that our processes naturally align with the POSI principles. This talk will discuss the journal and its history, how it aligns with open-source software methods, how it has grown community and in turn influenced the practices of the larger scholarly software community, and how its sustainability is aligned with POSI, along with challenges in all of these areas.",

BEAM associates a set omic features with clinical endpoints via regression models and then uses bootstrap resampling to determine statistical significance of the set. Unlike existing methods, BEAM uniquely accommodates an arbitrary number of omic profiles and endpoints.\nResults In simulations, BEAM performed similarly to the theoretically best simple test and outperformed other integrated analysis methods. In an example pediatric leukemia application, BEAM identified several genes with biological relevance established by a CRISPR assay that had been missed by univariate screens and other integrated analysis methods. Thus, BEAM is a powerful, flexible, and robust tool to identify genes for further laboratory and/or clinical research evaluation.\nAvailability Source code, documentation, and a vignette for BEAM are available on GitHub at: https://github.com/annaSeffernick/BEAMR.

		"abstract": "Extraction of meaningful biological insight from gene expression profiling often focuses on the identification of statistically enriched terms or pathways. These methods typically use gene sets as input data, and subsequently return overrepresented terms along with associated statistics describing their enrichment. This approach does not cater to analyses focused on a single gene-of-interest, particularly when the gene lacks prior functional characterization. To address this, we formulated GeneCOCOA, a method which utilizes context-specific gene co-expression and curated functional gene sets, but focuses on a user-supplied gene-of-interest. The co-expression between the gene-of-interest and subsets of genes from functional groups (e.g. pathways, GO terms) is derived using linear regression, and resulting root-mean-square error values are compared against background values obtained from randomly selected genes. The resulting p values provide a statistical ranking of functional gene sets from any collection, along with their associated terms, based on their co-expression with the gene of interest in a manner specific to the context and experiment. GeneCOCOA thereby provides biological insight into both gene function, and putative regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of the gene-of-interest is controlled. Despite its relative simplicity, GeneCOCOA outperforms similar methods in the accurate recall of known gene-disease associations. GeneCOCOA is formulated as an R package for ease-of-use, available at https://github.com/si-ze/geneCOCOA.\nAuthor summary Understanding the biological functions of different genes and their respective products is a key element of modern biological research. While one can examine the relative abundance of a gene product in transcriptomics data, this alone does not provide any clue to the biological relevance of the gene. Using a type of analysis called co-expression, it is possible to identify other genes which have similar patterns of regulation to a gene-of-interest, but again, this cannot tell you what a gene does. Genes whose function has previously been studied are often assembled into groups (e.g. pathways, ontologies), which can be used to annotate gene sets of interest. However, if a gene has not yet been characterized, it will not appear in these gene set enrichment analyses. Here, we propose a new method - GeneCOCOA - which uses co-expression of a single gene with genes in functional groups to identify which functional group a gene is most similar too, resulting in a putative function for the gene, even if it has not been studied before. We tested GeneCOCOA by using it to find gene-disease links which have already been scientifically studied, and showed that GeneCOCOA can do this more effectively than other available methods.",

		"abstract": "Inspired by the advancements in pre-trained Large Language Models, there has been a surge of studies in the Life Sciences focusing on constructing foundation models with large scale single-cell RNA-seq data. These studies typically involve pre-training a transformer model on large-scale single-cell sequencing data, followed by fine-tuning for a variety of downstream tasks, achieving notable performance. However, these models all share a common short-coming: to utilize the transformer architecture, originally designed for textual data, they artificially impose a sequential structure on genes within cells, simplifying the complex interactions between genes. Furthermore, they focus solely on transcriptomic data, neglecting other relevant biological information. To address these issues, here we introduce Cell-Graph Compass (CGC), the first foundational model that leverages graph structures to model single cells and describes cells from multiple perspectives, including transcriptional profiles, gene text summaries, transcription factor regulatory networks, gene co-expression patterns, and gene positional relationships. By incorporating self-attention mechanisms, we pretrained the model on 50 million human single-cell sequencing data, resulting in a robust digital representation of cells. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate that our approach can capture meaningful biological knowledge and achieve superior results in various problem scenarios, achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA).",

Despite their shared goal of addressing the same biological problem, these approaches have not been reconciled before. We devised a novel graph structure and algorithm aimed at mapping between the exonic parts and splicing events detected by the two different methods. Through simulations, we demonstrated disparities in sensitivity and specificity between splice junction-based and exon-based methods. When applied to empirical data, there were large discrepancies in the results, suggesting that the methods are complementary. With the discrepancies localized to individual events and exonic parts, we were able to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each approach.

		"abstract": "<p>The corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the resulting long-term neurological complications in patients, known as long COVID, have renewed the interest in the correlation between viral infections and neurodegenerative brain disorders. While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogenous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as: APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, α2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Additionally, viral amyloid induction led to a dramatic drop in the soluble protein concentration in the CSF. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF and result in soluble protein depletion, and thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>",

We map CS in more than 200 primary human and mouse cell types and increase CS annotations relative to the GENCODE database by 40%. Approximately half of all CS are used in few cell types, revealing that most genes only have one or two major 3′ ends. We incorporate the CS annotations into a computational pipeline, called scUTRquant, for rapid, accurate, and simultaneous quantification of gene and 3′UTR isoform expression from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. When applying scUTRquant to data from 474 cell types and 2134 perturbations, we discover extensive 3′UTR length changes across cell types that are as widespread and coordinately regulated as gene expression changes but affect mostly different genes. Our data indicate that mRNA abundance and mRNA length are two largely independent axes of gene regulation that together determine the amount and spatial organization of protein synthesis.",

		"abstract": "Obese subjects often exhibit hypersomnia accompanied by severe sleep fragmentation, while emerging evidence suggests that poor sleep quality promotes overeating and exacerbates diet-induced obesity (DIO). However, the neural circuit and signaling mechanism underlying the reciprocal control of appetite and sleep is yet not elucidated. Here, we report a neural circuit where prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2)-expressing neurons within the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of the brainstem received direct projections from neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R)-expressing neurons within the lateral preoptic area (LPO) of the hypothalamus. The RNA-Seq results revealed Prokr2 in the PBN is the most regulated GPCR signaling gene that is responsible for comorbidity of obesity and sleep dysfunction. Furthermore, those NPY2RLPO neurons are minimally active during NREM sleep and maximally active during wakefulness and REM sleep. Activation of the NPY2RLPO→PBN circuit or the postsynaptic PROKR2PBN neurons suppressed feeding of a high-fat diet and abrogated morbid sleep patterns in DIO mice. Further studies showed that genetic ablation of the PROKR2 signaling within PROKR2PBN neurons alleviated the hyperphagia and weight gain, and restored sleep dysfunction in DIO mice. We further discovered pterostilbene, a plant-derived stilbenoid, is a powerful anti-obesity and sleep-improving agent, robustly suppressed hyperphagia and promoted reconstruction of a healthier sleep architecture, thereby leading to significant weight loss. Collectively, our results unveil a neural mechanism for the reciprocal control of appetite and sleep, through which pterostilbene, along with a class of similarly structured compounds, may be developed as effective therapeutics for tackling obesity and sleep disorders.",

		"abstract": "Composite Hypothesis Testing (CHT) based on summary statistics has become a popular strategy to assess the effect of a same marker (or gene) jointly across multiple traits or at different omics levels. Although significant efforts have been made to develop efficient CHT procedures, most approaches face scalability constraints in terms of the number of traits/omics and markers to handle, or fail to account for potential correlations across traits efficiently. Methods relying on mixture models partially circumvent these limitations, but do not provide proper p-values, hampering the use of classical multiple testing procedures, graphical representations (e.g. Manhattan or QQ plots) and limiting their comparison with alternative approaches.\nWe introduce the qch_copula approach that combines the mixture model approach with a copula function to account for dependencies across traits/omics. The method comes with a pvalue that is consistently defined for any composite hypothesis to be tested. By significantly reducing the memory size burden of the EM algorithm during inference, the method scales to the analysis of several (up to 20) traits and 105 − 106 markers. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study, comparing our approach with 6 state-of-the-art methods recently developed. The qch_copula procedure efficiently controls Type I error rate and yields substantial gain in detecting various patterns of joint associations. The interest of the method is further illustrated by the joint analysis of 14 association studies to detect pleiotropic regions involved in psychiatric disorders.\nThe proposed method is implemented in the R package qch, available on CRAN.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, the discipline of statistics has begun reckoning with its difficult history. Institutions are reconsidering names that have honored key historical figures in statistics who have deep ties to eugenics movements and racial and class prejudice. These names, however, continue to appear in our classrooms, where we teach the methods created by these individuals, raising the question of how instructors should address their legacies. Three examples of famous statisticians and their work—Francis Galton’s use of conditional probabilities to demonstrate “hereditary talent,” Karl Pearson’s attempt to quantify the intelligence of Jewish immigrant students, and Ronald A. Fisher’s creation of the analysis of variance to de-emphasize environment in human development—highlight the intimate ties between statistics and eugenics. These examples, along with a discussion of the context of these men, eugenics movements, and the statisticians and scientists who opposed their eugenic programs, can humanize the field for students, teach them about the challenges in accurate and unbiased data collection and analysis, and connect historical mistakes to contemporary ethical issues. Confronting this history in the classroom can both improve the teaching of the statistical methodologies themselves and begin a broader conversation about the role of statistics in the world.

		"abstract": "Identifying differentially expressed transcripts poses a crucial yet challenging problem in transcriptomics. Substantial uncertainty is associated with the abundance estimates of certain transcripts which, if ignored, can lead to the exaggeration of false positives and, if included, may lead to reduced power. For a given set of RNA-Seq samples, TreeTerminus arranges transcripts in a hierarchical tree structure that encodes different layers of resolution for interpretation of the abundance of transcriptional groups, with uncertainty generally decreasing as one ascends the tree from the leaves. We introduce trenDi, which utilizes the tree structure from TreeTerminus for differential testing. The candidate nodes are determined in a data-driven manner to maximize the signal that can be extracted from the data while controlling for the uncertainty associated with estimating the transcript abundances. The identified candidate nodes can include transcripts and inner nodes, with no two nodes having an ancestor/descendant relationship. We evaluated our method on both simulated and experimental datasets, comparing its performance with other tree-based differential methods as well as with uncertainty-aware differential transcript/gene expression methods. Our method detects inner nodes that show a strong signal for differential expression, which would have been overlooked when analyzing the transcripts alone.",

Various approaches have been developed to map these interactions genome-wide, including those relying on interindividual epigenomic variation to identify groups of covariable regulatory elements, referred to as chromatin modules (CMs). While CM mapping allows to investigate the relationship between chromatin modularity and gene expression, the computational principles used for CM identification vary in their application and outcomes.\nRESULTS We comprehensively evaluate and streamline existing CM mapping tools and present guidelines for optimal utilization of epigenome data from a diverse population of individuals to assess regulatory coordination across the human genome. We showcase the effectiveness of our recommended practices by analysing distinct cell types and demonstrate cell type-specificity of CRE interactions in CMs and their relevance for gene expression. Integration of genotype information revealed that many non-coding disease-associated variants affect the activity of CMs in a cell type-specific manner by affecting the binding of cell type-specific transcription factors. We provide example cases that illustrate in detail how CMs can be used to deconstruct GWAS loci, understand variable expression of cell surface receptors in immune cells and reveal how genetic variation can impact the expression of prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nCONCLUSIONS Our study presents an optimal strategy for CM mapping, and reveals how CMs capture the coordination of CREs and its impact on gene expression. Non-coding genetic variants can disrupt this coordination, and we highlight how this may lead to disease predisposition in a cell type-specific manner.",

		"abstract": "Calcium imaging allows recording from hundreds of neurons in vivo with the ability to resolve single cell activity. Evaluating and analyzing neuronal responses, while also considering all dimensions of the data set to make specific conclusions, is extremely difficult. Often, descriptive statistics are used to analyze these forms of data. These analyses, however, remove variance by averaging the responses of single neurons across recording sessions, or across combinations of neurons, to create single quantitative metrics, losing the temporal dynamics of neuronal activity, and their responses relative to each other. Dimensionally Reduction (DR) methods serve as a good foundation for these analyses because they reduce the dimensions of the data into components, while still maintaining the variance. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an especially promising DR analysis method for analyzing activity recorded in calcium imaging because of its mathematical constraints, which include positivity and linearity. We adapt NMF for our analyses and compare its performance to alternative dimensionality reduction methods on both artificial and in vivo data. We find that NMF is well-suited for analyzing calcium imaging recordings, accurately capturing the underlying dynamics of the data, and outperforming alternative methods in common use.",

The mechanisms of the heterogeneous persistent symptoms and signs that comprise PASC are under investigation, and several studies have pointed to the central nervous and vascular systems as being potential sites of dysfunction. In the current study, we recruited individuals with PASC with diverse symptoms, and examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and circulating markers of vascular dysfunction. We used [11C]PBR28 PET neuroimaging, a marker of neuroinflammation, to compare 12 PASC individuals versus 43 normative healthy controls. We found significantly increased neuroinflammation in PASC versus controls across a wide swath of brain regions including midcingulate and anterior cingulate cortex, corpus callosum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and at the boundaries of ventricles. We also collected and analyzed peripheral blood plasma from the PASC individuals and found significant positive correlations between neuroinflammation and several circulating analytes related to vascular dysfunction. These results suggest that an interaction between neuroinflammation and vascular health may contribute to common symptoms of PASC.",

		"abstract": "Wastewater monitoring has provided health officials with early warnings for new COVID-19 outbreaks, but to date, no approach has been validated to distinguish signal (sustained surges) from noise (background variability) in wastewater data to alert officials to the need for heightened public health response. We analyzed 62 wk of data from 19 sites participating in the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network to characterize wastewater metrics around the Delta and Omicron surges. We found that wastewater data identified outbreaks 4 to 5 d before case data (reported on the earlier of the symptom start date or test collection date), on average. At most sites, correlations between wastewater and case data were similar regardless of how wastewater concentrations were normalized and whether calculated with county-level or sewershed-level cases, suggesting that officials may not need to geospatially align case data with sewershed boundaries to gain insights into disease transmission. Although wastewater trend lines captured clear differences in the Delta versus Omicron surge trajectories, no single wastewater metric (detectability, percent change, or flow-population normalized viral concentrations) reliably signaled when these surges started. After iteratively examining different combinations of these three metrics, we developed the Covid-SURGE (Signaling Unprecedented Rises in Groupwide Exposure) algorithm, which identifies unprecedented signals in the wastewater data. With a true positive rate of 82%, a false positive rate of 7%, and strong performance during both surges and in small and large sites, our algorithm provides public health officials with an automated way to flag community-level COVID-19 surges in real time.",

Here, we show that this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications of scientific results. Specifically, we present three preregistered, randomized experiments where participants saw the same scientific findings visualized as showing only inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both and answered questions about the size and importance of findings they were shown. Our results, composed of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts. In contrast, we find that depicting both inferential uncertainty and outcome variability leads to more accurate perceptions of results while appearing to leave other subjective impressions of the results unchanged, on average.",

		"abstract": "The use of biomedical knowledge graphs (BMKG) for knowledge representation and data integration has increased drastically in the past several years due to the size, diversity, and complexity of biomedical datasets and databases. Data extraction from a single dataset or database is usually not particularly challenging. However, if a scientific question must rely on integrative analysis across multiple databases or datasets, it can often take many hours to correctly and reproducibly extract and integrate data towards effective analysis. To overcome this issue, we created Petagraph, a large-scale BMKG that integrates biomolecular data into a schema incorporating the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Petagraph is instantiated on the Neo4j graph platform, and to date, has fifteen integrated biomolecular datasets. The majority of the data consists of entities or relationships related to genes, animal models, human phenotypes, drugs, and chemicals. Quantitative data sets containing values from gene expression analyses, chromatin organization, and genetic analyses have also been included. By incorporating models of biomolecular data types, the datasets can be traversed with hundreds of ontologies and controlled vocabularies native to the UMLS, effectively bringing the data to the ontologies. Petagraph allows users to analyze relationships between complex multi-omics data quickly and efficiently.",

		"abstract": "Most studies in psychology, neuroscience, and life science research make inferences about how strong an effect is on average in the population. Yet, many research questions could instead be answered by testing for the universality of the phenomenon under investigation. By using reliable experimental designs that maximise both sensitivity and specificity of individual experiments, each participant or subject can be treated as an independent replication. This approach is common in certain subfields. To date, there is however no formal approach for calculating the evidential value of such small sample studies and to define a priori evidence thresholds that must be met to draw meaningful conclusions. Here we present such a framework, based on the ratio of binomial probabilities between a model assuming the universality of the phenomenon versus the null hypothesis that any incidence of the effect is sporadic. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach, which permits strong conclusions from samples as small as 2-5 participants and the flexibility of sequential testing. This approach will enable researchers to preregister experimental designs based on small samples and thus enhance the utility and credibility of such studies.",

		"abstract": "Alternative splicing can substantially diversify biological cell states and influence cellular function. The functional impact of splicing has to be estimated at protein level, typically by mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics. Although this technology measures increasingly large peptides sets, distinguishing isoform-specific peptides are rare, limiting detection and quantification of splicing. We introduce MS-EmpiReS, a quantification-based computational approach for differential alternative splicing detection in proteomics data. Its core principle is to differentially quantify peptides mapping to different regions of genes. This approach increased the number of testable peptides hundred-fold in a clinical cancer cohort, resulting in a large number of cancer-relevant splicing candidates. Splicing events detected by both MS-EmpiReS and deep RNA sequencing correlated well but also provided complementary information. The proteomics data allowed us to define a per-sample splicing score to separate cancer conditions. Finally, deep brain proteomes from different mice separated strongly by the lower abundance protein splicing isoform.",

In this manuscript, we present the formalisation and pilot implementation of community protocol to enable FAIReR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, and Reproducible) sharing of ML models. The protocol consists of eight steps, including sharing model training code, dataset information, reproduced figures, model evaluation metrics, trained models, Dockerfiles, model metadata, and FAIR dissemination. Applying these measures we aim to build and share a comprehensive public collection of FAIR ML models in the BioModels repository through incentivized community curation. In a pilot implementation, we curated diverse ML models to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and we discussed the current challenges. Building a FAIReR collection of ML models will directly enhance the reproducibility and reusability of ML models, minimising the effort needed to reimplement models, maximising the impact on the application and significantly accelerating the advancement in the field of life science and medicine.",

Here, we report a crucial role for the lncRNA Neat1 in astrocyte dysfunction and memory deficits associated with AD. Transcriptomics analysis show abnormally high expression levels of NEAT1 in the brains of AD patients relative to aged-matched healthy controls, with the most significantly elevated levels in glial cells. In a human transgenic APP-J20 (J20) mouse model of AD, RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization characterization of Neat1 expression in hippocampal astrocyte versus non-astrocyte cell populations revealed a significant increase in Neat1 expression in astrocytes of male, but not female, mice. This corresponded with increased seizure susceptibility in J20 male mice. Interestingly, Neat1 deficiency in the dCA1 in J20 male mice did not alter seizure threshold. Mechanistically, Neat1 deficiency in the dorsal area CA1 of the hippocampus (dCA1) J20 male mice significantly improved hippocampus-dependent memory. Neat1 deficiency also remarkably reduced astrocyte reactivity markers suggesting that Neat1 overexpression is associated with astrocyte dysfunction induced by hAPP/Aβ in the J20 mice. Together, these findings indicate that abnormal Neat1 overexpression may contribute to memory deficits in the J20 AD model not through altered neuronal activity, but through astrocyte dysfunction.",

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm—and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it—as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to “ban” p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.",

		"abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with complex and heterogeneous biology. Although several genomic classifications have been proposed, there is a growing interest in going beyond genomics to stratify AML. In this study, we profile the sphingolipid family of bioactive molecules in 213 primary AML samples and 30 common human AML cell lines. Using an integrative approach, we identify two distinct sphingolipid subtypes in AML characterized by a reciprocal abundance of hexosylceramide (Hex) and sphingomyelin (SM) species. The two Hex-SM clusters organize diverse samples more robustly than known AML driver mutations and are coupled to latent transcriptional states. Using transcriptomic data, we develop a machine-learning classifier to infer the Hex-SM status of AML cases in TCGA and BeatAML clinical repositories. The analyses show that the sphingolipid subtype with deficient Hex and abundant SM is enriched for leukemic stemness transcriptional programs and comprises an unappreciated high-risk subgroup with poor clinical outcomes. Our sphingolipid-focused examination of AML identifies patients least likely to benefit from standard of care and raises the possibility that sphingolipidomic interventions could switch the subtype of AML patients who otherwise lack targetable alternatives.\nKey Points 1.Sphingolipidomics separates acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and cell lines into two subtypes.2.The subtype with low hexosylceramide and high sphingomyelin defines a new high-risk subtype with poor clinical outcomes.",

		"abstract": "TO THE EDITOR:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive, heterogeneous disease with genomic subtypes that are increasingly treated differently. There is a growing interest in going beyond mutations and cytogenetics to stratify AML. Recent work has combined proteomics,1 signaling,2,3 or immunophenotypes4 with integrated genomic-transcriptomic measurements to improve AML risk classifications.5 Although invaluable as resources, such approaches can neither extend retroactively to existing repositories nor prospectively to new AML cases lacking these data types. We sought to develop a more extensible approach involving sphingolipids (Figure 1A), a family of bioactive molecules implicated in AML pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance6,7 that differentially regulate cell proliferation,8 differentiation,9 autophagy,10 apoptosis,11 and immune cell activation.12 Sphingolipid abundances in AML vary heterogeneously and ratiometrically,13 prompting us to ask whether systematic sphingolipidomic profiling could meaningfully stratify patients with AML and common AML cell lines.",

		"abstract": "There is a considerable body of work in the field of computer science on the topic of sparse graph recovery, particularly with regards to the innovative deep learning approaches that have been recently introduced. Despite this abundance of research, however, these methods are often not applied to the recovery of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). This work aims to initiate this trend by highlighting the potential benefits of using these computational techniques in the recovery of GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing or bulk sequencing based gene expression data. GRNs are directed graphs that capture the direct dependence between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. Understanding these interactions is vital for studying the mechanisms in cell differentiation, growth and development. We categorize graph recovery methods into four main types based on the underlying formulations: Regression-based, Graphical Lasso, Markov Networks and Directed Acyclic Graphs. We selected representative methods from each category and made modifications to incorporate transcription factor information as a prior to ensure successful reconstruction of GRNs.",

Metabolism is a complex, interdependent network, and local perturbations can have indirect effects that are pervasive across the metabolic network. Current analytical and technical limitations have long created a bottleneck in metabolic data interpretation. To address these shortcomings, we developed Metaboverse, a user-friendly tool to facilitate data exploration and hypothesis generation. Here we introduce algorithms that leverage the metabolic network to extract complex reaction patterns from data. To minimize the impact of missing measurements within the network, we introduce methods that enable pattern recognition across multiple reactions. Using Metaboverse, we identify a previously undescribed metabolite signature that correlated with survival outcomes in early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients. Using a yeast model, we identify metabolic responses suggesting an adaptive role of citrate homeostasis during mitochondrial dysfunction facilitated by the citrate transporter, Ctp1. We demonstrate that Metaboverse augments the user’s ability to extract meaningful patterns from multi-omics datasets to develop actionable hypotheses.",

		"abstract": "Gene sets are being increasingly leveraged to make high-level biological inferences from transcriptomic data; however, existing gene set analysis methods rely on overly conservative, heuristic approaches for quantifying the statistical significance of gene set enrichment. We created Nonparametric analytical-Rank-based Enrichment Analysis (NaRnEA) to facilitate accurate and robust gene set analysis with an optimal null model derived using the information theoretic Principle of Maximum Entropy. By measuring the differential activity of ~2500 transcriptional regulatory proteins based on the differential expression of each protein’s transcriptional targets between primary tumors and normal tissue samples in three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we demonstrate that NaRnEA critically improves in two widely used gene set analysis methods: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and analytical-Rank-based Enrichment Analysis (aREA). We show that the NaRnEA-inferred differential protein activity is significantly correlated with differential protein abundance inferred from independent, phenotype-matched mass spectrometry data in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), confirming the statistical and biological accuracy of our approach. Additionally, our analysis crucially demonstrates that the sample-shuffling empirical null models leveraged by GSEA and aREA for gene set analysis are overly conservative, a shortcoming that is avoided by the newly developed Maximum Entropy analytical null model employed by NaRnEA.",

		"abstract": "Accurately inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is a critical and challenging task in biology. GRNs model the activatory and inhibitory interactions between genes and are inherently causal in nature. To accurately identify GRNs, perturbational data is required. However, most GRN discovery methods only operate on observational data. Recent advances in neural network-based causal discovery methods have significantly improved causal discovery, including handling interventional data, improvements in performance and scalability. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal discovery methods in biology poses challenges, such as noisy data and a large number of samples. Thus, adapting the causal discovery methods is necessary to handle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce DiscoGen, a neural network-based GRN discovery method that can denoise gene expression measurements and handle interventional data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA neural network-based causal discovery methods.",

Here, we examine two remaining open questions: (i) What are the best combinations of data transformations and statistical test methods, and (ii) how do pseudo-bulk approaches perform in single-sample designs? We evaluated the performance of 343 DE pipelines (combinations of eight types of count matrix transformations and ten statistical tests) on simulated and real-world data, in terms of precision, sensitivity, and false discovery rate. We confirm superior performance of pseudo-bulk approaches without prior transformation. For within-sample comparisons, we advise the use of three pseudo-replicates, and provide a simple R package DElegate to facilitate application of this approach.",

		"abstract": "Knowing a drug’s mechanism of action (MOA) is essential for its clinical success by selecting the best indications, likely responders, and combinations. Yet knowledge of many drugs' MOA remains lacking. Here we present DeepTarget, a computational tool for deep characterization of cancer drugs’ MOA by integrating existing large-scale genetic and drug screens. Spanning ~1500 drugs across ~18K possible target genes, DeepTarget predicts: (1) a drug’s primary target(s), (2) whether it specifically targets the wild-type or mutated target forms, and (3) the secondary target(s) that mediate its response when the primary target is not expressed. We first tested and successfully validated DeepTarget in a total of eleven unseen gold-standard datasets, with an average AUC of 0.82, 0.77, and 0.92 for the above three prediction abilities, respectively. We then proceed to use it in a wide range of applications: First, we find that DeepTarget’s predicted specificity of a drug to its target is strongly associated with its success in clinical trials and is higher in its FDA-approved indications. Second, DeepTarget predicts candidate drugs for targeting currently undruggable cancer oncogenes and their mutant forms. Finally, DeepTarget predicts new targets for drugs with unknown MOA and new secondary targets of approved drugs. Taken together, DeepTarget is a new computational framework for accelerating drug prioritization and its target discovery by leveraging large-scale genetic and drug screens.",

		"abstract": "Hetnets, short for “heterogeneous networks”, contain multiple node and relationship types and offer a way to encode biomedical knowledge. One such example, Hetionet connects 11 types of nodes — including genes, diseases, drugs, pathways, and anatomical structures — with over 2 million edges of 24 types. Previous work has demonstrated that supervised machine learning methods applied to such networks can identify drug repurposing opportunities. However, a training set of known relationships does not exist for many types of node pairs, even when it would be useful to examine how nodes of those types are meaningfully connected. For example, users may be curious not only how metformin is related to breast cancer, but also how the GJA1 gene might be involved in insomnia. We developed a new procedure, termed hetnet connectivity search, that proposes important paths between any two nodes without requiring a supervised gold standard. The algorithm behind connectivity search identifies types of paths that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (based on node degree alone). We find that predictions are broadly similar to those from previously described supervised approaches for certain node type pairs. Scoring of individual paths is based on the most specific paths of a given type. Several optimizations were required to precompute significant instances of node connectivity at the scale of large knowledge graphs. We implemented the method on Hetionet and provide an online interface at https://het.io/search. We provide an open source implementation of these methods in our new Python package named hetmatpy.",

		"abstract": "Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.\n\n\nOwnership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.",

Numerous prediction methods have been developed as cheap alternatives to biological experiments, reporting surprisingly high accuracy estimates. We systematically investigated how much reproducible deep learning models depend on data leakage, sequence similarities, and node degree information, and compared them to basic machine learning models. We found that overlaps between training and test sets resulting from random splitting lead to strongly overestimated performances. In this setting, models learn solely from sequence similarities and node degrees. When data leakage is avoided by minimizing sequence similarities between training and test set, performances become random. Moreover, baseline models directly leveraging sequence similarity and network topology show good performances at a fraction of the computational cost. Thus, we advocate that any improvements should be reported relative to baseline methods in the future. Our findings suggest that predicting protein-protein interactions remains an unsolved task for proteins showing little sequence similarity to previously studied proteins, highlighting that further experimental research into the “dark” protein interactome and better computational methods are needed.",

		"abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies are characterized by the aggregation of tau into soluble and insoluble forms (including tangles and neuropil threads). In humans, a fraction of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated N-terminal to mid-domain tau species, including the aggregated forms, are secreted into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some of these CSF tau species can be measured as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, starting from early stages of disease. While in animal models of AD pathology, soluble tau aggregates have been shown to disrupt neuronal function, it is unclear whether the tau species present in CSF will modulate neural activity. Here, we have developed and applied a novel approach to examine the electrophysiological effects of CSF from patients with a tau-positive biomarker profile. The method involves incubation of acutely-isolated wild-type mouse hippocampal brain slices with small volumes of diluted human CSF, followed by a suite of electrophysiological recording methods to evaluate their effects on neuronal function from single cells through to the network level. Comparison of the toxicity profiles of the same CSF samples, with and without immuno-depletion for tau, has enabled a pioneering demonstration that CSF-tau potently modulates neuronal function. We demonstrate that CSF-tau mediates an increase in neuronal excitability in single cells. We then observed, at the network level, increased input-output responses and enhanced paired-pulse facilitation as well as an increase in long-term potentiation. Finally, we show that CSF-tau modifies the generation and maintenance of hippocampal theta oscillations, which have important roles in learning and memory and are known to be altered in AD patients. Together, we describe a novel method for screening human CSF-tau to understand functional effects on neuron and network activity, which could have far-reaching benefits in understanding tau pathology, thus allowing for the development of better targeted treatments for tauopathies in the future.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab",

		"abstract": "Single-cell proteomics has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it offers more functional relevance than single-cell transcriptomics. However, most work to date focused on cell typing, which has been widely accomplished by single-cell transcriptomics. Here we report the use of single-cell proteomics to measure the correlations between the translational levels of any pair of proteins in a single mammalian cell. In measuring pairwise correlations among ∼1,000 proteins in a population of homogeneous K562 cells in a steady-state condition, we observed multiple correlated protein modules (CPMs), each containing a group of highly positively correlated proteins that are functionally interacting and collectively involved in certain biological functions, such as protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Some CPMs are shared across different cell types while others are cell-type specific. Widely studied in omics analyses, pairwise correlations are often measured by introducing perturbations to bulk samples. However, some correlations of gene or protein expression in steady-state condition would be masked by perturbation. The single-cell correlations probed in our experiment reflect intrinsic steady-state fluctuations in the absence of perturbation. We note that observed correlations between proteins are experimentally more distinct and functionally more relevant than those between corresponding mRNAs measured in single-cell transcriptomics. By virtue of single-cell proteomics, functional coordination of proteins is manifested through CPMs.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab",

We hypothesize that the constraint on missense variation at individual amino acid sites is largely shaped by direct interactions with 3D neighboring sites. To quantify this constraint, we introduce a framework called COntact Set MISsense tolerance (or COSMIS) and comprehensively map the landscape of 3D mutational constraint on 6.1 million amino acid sites covering 16,533 human proteins. We show that 3D mutational constraint is pervasive and that the level of constraint is strongly associated with disease relevance both at the site and the protein level. We demonstrate that COSMIS performs significantly better at variant interpretation tasks than other population-based constraint metrics while also providing structural insight into the functional roles of constrained sites. We anticipate that COSMIS will facilitate the interpretation of protein-coding variation in evolution and prioritization of sites for mechanistic investigation.",

		"abstract": "Transcriptomic analyses are commonly used to identify differentially expressed genes between patients and controls, or within individuals across disease courses. These methods, whilst effective, cannot encompass the combinatorial effects of genes driving disease. We applied rule-based machine learning (RBML) models and rule networks (RN) to an existing paediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) blood expression dataset, with the goal of developing gene networks to separate low and high disease activity (DA1 and DA3). The resultant model had an 81% accuracy to distinguish between DA1 and DA3, with unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealing additional subgroups indicative of the immune axis involved or state of disease flare. These subgroups correlated with clinical variables, suggesting that the gene sets identified may further the understanding of gene networks that act in concert to drive disease progression. This included roles for genes (i) induced by interferons (IFI35 and OTOF), (ii) key to SLE cell types (KLRB1 encoding CD161), or (iii) with roles in autophagy and NF-κB pathway responses (CKAP4). As demonstrated here, RBML approaches have the potential to reveal novel gene patterns from within a heterogeneous disease, facilitating patient clinical and therapeutic stratification.",

		"abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a clinical subset of inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by patchy transmural inflammation across the gastrointestinal tract. Although the exact etiology remains unknown, recent findings suggest that it is a complex multifactorial disease with contributions from the host genetics and environmental factors such as the microbiome. We have shown that the T cell repertoire of CD patients harbors a group of highly expanded T cells which hints toward an antigen-mediated pathology. To profile the immunological signature of CD at a high-resolution we simultaneously profiled the αβ and γδ T cell repertoire in addition to the B cell repertoire of both the blood and the colonic mucosa for 27 treatment-naive CD patients and 27 age-matched symptomatic controls. Regardless of disease, we observed multiple physiological differences between the immune repertoire of blood and colonic mucosa. Additionally, by comparing the repertoire of CD patients relative to controls, we observed different alterations that were only detected in the blood or colonic mucosa. These include a depletion of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the blood repertoire, an expansion of TRAV29/DV5-TRAJ5+ clonotypes and a significant depletion of multiple IGHV3-33-IGHJ4+ and IGHV3-33-IGHJ6+ clonotypes in the blood and gut IGH repertoire of CD patients. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of studying the immune repertoire in a tissue-specific manner and the need to profile the T and B cell immune repertoire of gut tissues.",

Here, we provide an optimized pipeline to estimate cellular composition in human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) from publicly available bulk RNA-Seq using signature profiles from our previously published full-length single nuclei (sn)RNA-Seq of the same depot. Individuals with obesity had greater proportions of macrophages and lower proportions of adipocyte sub-populations and vascular cells compared with lean individuals. Two months of diet-induced weight loss (DIWL) increased the estimated proportions of macrophages; however, two years of DIWL reduced the estimated proportions of macrophages, thereby suggesting a bi-phasic nature of cellular remodeling of ASAT during weight loss. Our optimized high-throughput pipeline facilitates the assessment of composition changes of highly characterized cell types in large numbers of ASAT samples using low-cost bulk RNA-Seq. Our data reveal novel changes in cellular heterogeneity and its association with cardiometabolic health in humans with obesity and following weight loss.",

		"abstract": "The advent of high-throughput transcriptomics provides an opportunity to advance mechanistic understanding of transcriptional processes and their connections to cellular function at an un-precedented, genome-wide scale. These transcriptional systems, which involve discrete, stochastic events, are naturally modeled using Chemical Master Equations (CMEs), which can be solved for probability distributions to fit biophysical rates that govern system dynamics. While CME models have been used as standards in fluorescence transcriptomics for decades to analyze single species RNA distributions, there are often no closed-form solutions to CMEs that model multiple species, such as nascent and mature RNA transcript counts. This has prevented the application of standard likelihood-based statistical methods for analyzing high-throughput, multi-species transcriptomic datasets using biophysical models. Inspired by recent work in machine learning to learn solutions to complex dynamical systems, we leverage neural networks and statistical understanding of system distributions to produce accurate approximations to a steady-state bivariate distribution for a model of the RNA life-cycle that includes nascent and mature molecules. The steady-state distribution to this simple model has no closed-form solution and requires intensive numerical solving techniques: our approach reduces likelihood evaluation time by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate two approaches, where solutions are approximated by (1) learning the weights of kernel distributions with constrained parameters, or (2) learning both weights and scaling factors for parameters of kernel distributions. We show that our strategies, denoted by kernel weight regression (KWR) and parameter scaled kernel weight regression (psKWR), respectively, enable broad exploration of parameter space and can be used in existing likelihood frameworks to infer transcriptional burst sizes, RNA splicing rates, and mRNA degradation rates from experimental transcriptomic data.\nStatement of significance The life-cycles of RNA molecules are governed by a set of stochastic events that result in heterogeneous gene expression patterns in genetically identical cells, resulting in the vast diversity of cellular types, responses, and functions. While stochastic models have been used in the field of fluorescence transcriptomics to understand how cells exploit and regulate this inherent randomness, biophysical models have not been widely applied to high-throughput transcriptomic data, as solutions are often intractable and computationally impractical to scale. Our neural approximations of solutions to a two-species transcriptional system enable efficient inference of rates that drive the dynamics of gene expression, thus providing a scalable route to extracting mechanistic information from increasingly available multi-species single-cell transcriptomics data.",

		"abstract": "The precise mechanisms that lead to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease are unknown. Here we identify amyloid-plaque-associated axonal spheroids as prominent contributors to neural network dysfunction. Using intravital calcium and voltage imaging, we show that a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease demonstrates severe disruption in long-range axonal connectivity. This disruption is caused by action-potential conduction blockades due to enlarging spheroids acting as electric current sinks in a size-dependent manner. Spheroid growth was associated with an age-dependent accumulation of large endolysosomal vesicles and was mechanistically linked with Pld3—a potential Alzheimer’s-disease-associated risk gene1 that encodes a lysosomal protein2,3 that is highly enriched in axonal spheroids. Neuronal overexpression of Pld3 led to endolysosomal vesicle accumulation and spheroid enlargement, which worsened axonal conduction blockades. By contrast, Pld3 deletion reduced endolysosomal vesicle and spheroid size, leading to improved electrical conduction and neural network function. Thus, targeted modulation of endolysosomal biogenesis in neurons could potentially reverse axonal spheroid-induced neural circuit abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease, independent of amyloid removal.",

		"abstract": "Autoimmune diseases, among the most common disorders of young adults, are mediated by genetic and environmental factors. Although CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in preventing autoimmunity, the molecular mechanism underlying their dysfunction is unknown. Here, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of Tregs in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) to identify critical transcriptional programs regulating human autoimmunity. We found that up-regulation of a primate-specific short isoform of PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1-S) induces expression of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) independent from the evolutionarily conserved long PRDM1, which led to destabilization of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and Treg dysfunction. This aberrant PRDM1-S/SGK1 axis is shared among other autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the chromatin landscape profiling in Tregs from individuals with MS revealed enriched activating protein–1 (AP-1)/interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor binding as candidate upstream regulators of PRDM1-S expression and Treg dysfunction. Our study uncovers a mechanistic model where the evolutionary emergence of PRDM1-S and epigenetic priming of AP-1/IRF may be key drivers of dysfunctional Tregs in autoimmune diseases.",

The TH17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between TH17 and other CD4+ T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for controlling TH17 cell differentiation.",

		"abstract": "Pathway enrichment extensively used in the analysis of Omics data for gaining biological insights into the functional roles of pre-defined subsets of genes, proteins and metabolites. A large number of methods have been proposed in the literature for this task. The vast majority of these methods use as input expression levels of the biomolecules under study together with their membership in pathways of interest. The latest generation of pathway enrichment methods also leverages information on the topology of the underlying pathways, which as evidence from their evaluation reveals, lead to improved sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, a systematic empirical comparison of such methods is still lacking, making selection of the most suitable method for a specific experimental setting challenging. This comparative study of nine network-based methods for pathway enrichment analysis aims to provide a systematic evaluation of their performance based on three real data sets with different number of features (genes/metabolites) and number of samples.",

The key idea behind enrichment analysis is: given a set of significantly expressed genes (or metabolites), use that set to infer a smaller set of perturbed biological pathways or processes, in which those genes (or metabolites) play a role. Enrichment computations rely on collections of defined biological pathways and/or processes, which are usually drawn from pathway databases.

Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.",

		"abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has shown great promise in the unsupervised task of clustering. That said, while in classical (i.e., non-deep) clustering the benefits of the nonparametric approach are well known, most deep-clustering methods are parametric: namely, they require a predefined and fixed number of clusters, denoted by K. When K is unknown, however, using model-selection criteria to choose its optimal value might become computationally expensive, especially in DL as the training process would have to be repeated numerous times. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective deep-clustering method that does not require knowing the value of K as it infers it during the learning. Using a split/merge framework, a dynamic architecture that adapts to the changing K, and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing nonparametric methods (both classical and deep ones). While the very few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability, we demonstrate ours by being the first to report the performance of such a method on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the importance of inferring K by showing how methods that fix it deteriorate in performance when their assumed K value gets further from the ground-truth one, especially on imbalanced datasets.

		"abstract": "Mutational processes in tumors create distinctive patterns of mutations, composed of neutral “passenger” mutations and oncogenic drivers that have quantifiable effects on the proliferation and survival of cancer cell lineages. Increases in proliferation and survival are mediated by natural selection, which can be quantified by comparing the frequency at which we detect substitutions to the frequency at which we expect to detect substitutions assuming neutrality. Most of the variants detectable with whole-exome sequencing in tumors are neutral or nearly neutral in effect, and thus the processes generating the majority of mutations may not be the primary sources of the tumorigenic mutations. Across 24 cancer types, we identify the contributions of mutational processes to each oncogenic variant and quantify the degree to which each process contributes to tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the origination of variants driving melanomas and lung cancers is predominantly attributable to the preventable, exogenous mutational processes associated with ultraviolet light and tobacco exposure, respectively, whereas the origination of selected variants in gliomas and prostate adenocarcinomas is largely attributable to endogenous processes associated with aging. Preventable mutations associated with pathogen exposure and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme activity account for a large proportion of the cancer effect within head-and-neck, bladder, cervical, and breast cancers. These attributions complement epidemiological approaches—revealing the burden of cancer driven by single-nucleotide variants caused by either endogenous or exogenous, nonpreventable, or preventable processes, and crucially inform public health strategies.",

But when the spectrum is nearly continuous, any distinction between components that we keep and those that we ignore becomes arbitrary; it then is natural to ask what happens as we vary this arbitrary cutoff. We argue that this problem is analogous to the momentum shell renormalization group (RG). Following this analogy, we can define relevant and irrelevant operators, where the role of dimensionality is played by properties of the eigenvalue density. These results also suggest an approach to the analysis of real data. As an example, we study neural activity in the vertebrate retina as it responds to naturalistic movies, and find evidence of behavior controlled by a nontrivial fixed point. Applied to financial data, our analysis separates modes dominated by sampling noise from a smaller but still macroscopic number of modes described by a non--Gaussian distribution.",

In many applications, it is of interest to discover variation that is enriched in a \"foreground\" dataset relative to a \"background\" dataset. Recently, contrastive principal component analysis (CPCA) was proposed for this setting. However, the lack of a formal probabilistic model makes it difficult to reason about CPCA and to tune its hyperparameter. In this work, we propose probabilistic contrastive principal component analysis (PCPCA), a model-based alternative to CPCA. We discuss how to set the hyperparameter in theory and in practice, and we show several of PCPCA's advantages over CPCA, including greater interpretability, uncertainty quantification and principled inference, robustness to noise and missing data, and the ability to generate data from the model. We demonstrate PCPCA's performance through a series of simulations and case-control experiments with datasets of gene expression, protein expression, and images.",

During the last few hundred years, chemists compiled the language of chemical synthesis inferring a series of “reaction rules” from knowing how atoms rearrange during a chemical transformation, a process called atom-mapping. Atom-mapping is a laborious experimental task and, when tackled with computational methods, requires continuous annotation of chemical reactions and the extension of logically consistent directives. Here, we demonstrate that Transformer Neural Networks learn atom-mapping information between products and reactants without supervision or human labeling. Using the Transformer attention weights, we build a chemically agnostic, attention-guided reaction mapper and extract coherent chemical grammar from unannotated sets of reactions. Our method shows remarkable performance in terms of accuracy and speed, even for strongly imbalanced and chemically complex reactions with nontrivial atom-mapping. It provides the missing link between data-driven and rule-based approaches for numerous chemical reaction tasks.",

		"abstract": "Mapping genetic interactions (GIs) can reveal important insights into cellular function and has potential translational applications. There has been great progress in developing high-throughput experimental systems for measuring GIs (e.g. with double knockouts) as well as in defining computational methods for inferring (imputing) unknown interactions. However, existing computational methods for imputation have largely been developed for and applied in baker’s yeast, even as experimental systems have begun to allow measurements in other contexts. Importantly, existing methods face a number of limitations in requiring specific side information and with respect to computational cost. Further, few have addressed how GIs can be imputed when data are scarce.In this article, we address these limitations by presenting a new imputation framework, called Extensible Matrix Factorization (EMF). EMF is a framework of composable models that flexibly exploit cross-species information in the form of GI data across multiple species, and arbitrary side information in the form of kernels (e.g. from protein–protein interaction networks). We perform a rigorous set of experiments on these models in matched GI datasets from baker’s and fission yeast. These include the first such experiments on genome-scale GI datasets in multiple species in the same study. We find that EMF models that exploit side and cross-species information improve imputation, especially in data-scarce settings. Further, we show that EMF outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning method, even when using strictly less data, and incurs orders of magnitude less computational cost.Implementations of models and experiments are available at: https://github.com/lrgr/EMF.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

		"abstract": "While the publication of Linked Data has become increasingly common, the process tends to be a relatively complicated and heavy-weight one. Linked Data is typically published by centralized entities in the form of larger dataset releases, which has the downside that there is a central bottleneck in the form of the organization or individual responsible for the releases. Moreover, certain kinds of data entries, in particular those with subjective or original content, currently do not fit into any existing dataset and are therefore more difficult to publish. To address these problems, we present here an approach to use nanopublications and a decentralized network of services to allow users to directly publish small Linked Data statements through a simple and user-friendly interface, called Nanobench, powered by semantic templates that are themselves published as nanopublications. The published nanopublications are cryptographically verifiable and can be queried through a redundant and decentralized network of services, based on the grlc API generator and a new quad extension of Triple Pattern Fragments. We show here that these two kinds of services are complementary and together allow us to query nanopublications in a reliable and efficient manner. We also show that Nanobench makes it indeed very easy for users to publish Linked Data statements, even for those who have no prior experience in Linked Data publishing.",

		"abstract": "Genomic region sets summarize functional genomics data and define locations of interest in the genome such as regulatory regions or transcription factor binding sites. The number of publicly available region sets has increased dramatically, leading to challenges in data analysis.We propose a new method to represent genomic region sets as vectors, or embeddings, using an adapted word2vec approach. We compared our approach to two simpler methods based on interval unions or term frequency-inverse document frequency and evaluated the methods in three ways: First, by classifying the cell line, antibody or tissue type of the region set; second, by assessing whether similarity among embeddings can reflect simulated random perturbations of genomic regions; and third, by testing robustness of the proposed representations to different signal thresholds for calling peaks. Our word2vec-based region set embeddings reduce dimensionality from more than a hundred thousand to 100 without significant loss in classification performance. The vector representation could identify cell line, antibody and tissue type with over 90% accuracy. We also found that the vectors could quantitatively summarize simulated random perturbations to region sets and are more robust to subsampling the data derived from different peak calling thresholds. Our evaluations demonstrate that the vectors retain useful biological information in relatively lower-dimensional spaces. We propose that vector representation of region sets is a promising approach for efficient analysis of genomic region data.https://github.com/databio/regionset-embedding.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

		"abstract": "We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used ($p$ value or $z$ score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.",

		"abstract": "A fundamental task in the analysis of data sets with many variables is screening for associations. This can be cast as a multiple testing task, where the objective is achieving high detection power while controlling type I error. We consider m hypothesis tests represented by pairs ((Pi,Xi))1≤i≤m of p-values Pi and covariates Xi, such that Pi⊥Xi if Hi is null. Here, we show how to use information potentially available in the covariates about heterogeneities among hypotheses to increase power compared to conventional procedures that only use the Pi. To this end, we upgrade existing weighted multiple testing procedures through the independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) framework to use data-driven weights that are calculated as a function of the covariates. Finite sample guarantees, for example false discovery rate control, are derived from cross-weighting, a data-splitting approach that enables learning the weight-covariate function without overfitting as long as the hypotheses can be partitioned into independent folds, with arbitrary within-fold dependence. IHW has increased power compared to methods that do not use covariate information. A key implication of IHW is that hypothesis rejection in common multiple testing setups should not proceed according to the ranking of the p-values, but by an alternative ranking implied by the covariate-weighted p-values.",

		"abstract": "Objectives We aimed to investigate changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using arterial spin labelling (ASL) in patients with visual snow syndrome (VSS), in order to understand more about the underlying neurobiology of the condition, which remains mostly unknown.\nMethods We performed an MRI study in which whole-brain maps of rCBF were obtained using pseudo-continuous ASL. Twenty-four patients with VSS and an equal number of gender and age-matched healthy volunteers took part in the study. All subjects were examined with both a visual paradigm consisting of a visual-snow like stimulus, simulating key features of the snow, and a blank screen at rest, randomly presented.\nResults Patients with VSS had higher rCBF than controls over an extensive brain network, including the bilateral cuneus, precuneus, supplementary motor cortex, premotor cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as the left primary auditory cortex, fusiform gyrus and cerebellum. These areas were largely analogous comparing patients either at rest, or when looking at a ‘snow-like’ visual stimulus. This widespread, similar pattern of perfusion differences in either condition suggests a neurophysiological signature of visual snow. Furthermore, right insula rCBF was increased in VSS subjects compared with controls during visual stimulation, reflecting a greater task-related change and suggesting a difference in interoceptive processing with constant perception of altered visual input.\nConclusion The data suggest VSS patients have marked differences in brain processing of visual stimuli, validating its neurobiological basis.",

		"abstract": "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular method for analyzing strictly positive data due to its relatively straightforward interpretation. However, NMF has a reputation as a less efficient alternative to the singular value decomposition (SVD), a standard operation that is highly optimized in most linear algebra libraries. Sparse single-cell sequencing assays, now feasible in thousands of subjects and millions of cells, generate data matrices with tens of thousands of strictly non-negative transcript abundance entries. We present an extremely fast NMF implementation made available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package that rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). NMF can now be run quickly on desktop computers to analyze sparse single-cell datasets consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells. Our method improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to increase interpretability, guarantee consistent regularization penalties across different random initializations, and symmetry in symmetric factorizations. We use our method to show how NMF models learned on standard log-normalized count data are interpretable dimensional reductions, describe interpretable patterns of coordinated gene activities, and explain biologically relevant metadata. We believe NMF has the potential to replace PCA in most single-cell analyses, and the presented NMF implementation overcomes previous challenges with long runtime.",

This valuable resource remains acutely underused because discovering particular samples from this ever-growing data collection remains a significant challenge. The major impediment is that sample attributes are routinely described using varied terminologies written in unstructured natural language. We propose a natural-language-processing-based machine learning approach (NLP-ML) to infer tissue and cell-type annotations for –omics samples based only on their free-text metadata. NLP-ML works by creating numerical representations of sample descriptions and using these representations as features in a supervised learning classifier that predicts tissue/cell-type terms. Our approach significantly outperforms an advanced graph-based reasoning annotation method (MetaSRA) and a baseline exact string matching method (TAGGER). Model similarities between related tissues demonstrate that NLP-ML models capture biologically-meaningful signals in text. Additionally, these models correctly classify tissue-associated biological processes and diseases based on their text descriptions alone. NLP-ML models are nearly as accurate as models based on gene-expression profiles in predicting sample tissue annotations but have the distinct capability to classify samples irrespective of the –omics experiment type based on their text metadata. Python NLP-ML prediction code and trained tissue models are available at https://github.com/krishnanlab/txt2onto.",

After CSD, ~11% of the CSF proteome is altered, with up-regulation of proteins that directly activate receptors in the trigeminal ganglion. CSF collected from animals exposed to CSD activates trigeminal neurons in naïve mice in part by CSF-borne calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP).

The many genes that have been genetically associated with cancer or shown to directly contribute to oncogenesis vary widely between tumor types, but common gene signatures that relate to core cancer pathways have also been identified. It is not clear, however, whether there exist additional sets of genes or transcriptomic features that are less well known in cancer biology but that are also commonly deregulated across several cancer types.",

Here we demonstrate single-cell RNA-5′end-sequencing (sc-end5-seq) methods can detect transcribed CREs (tCREs), enabling simultaneous quantification of gene expression and enhancer activities in a single assay at no extra cost. We showed enhancer RNAs can be detected using sc-end5-seq methods with either random or oligo(dT) priming. To analyze tCREs in single cells, we developed SCAFE (Single Cell Analysis of Five-prime Ends) to identify genuine tCREs and analyze their activities (https://github.com/chung-lab/scafe). As compared to accessible CRE (aCRE, based on chromatin accessibility), tCREs are more accurate in predicting CRE interactions by co-activity, more sensitive in detecting shifts in alternative promoter usage and more enriched in diseases heritability. Our results highlight additional dimensions within sc-end5-seq data which can be used for interrogating gene regulation and disease heritability.",

In this paper, we elaborate basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow by defining 3 phases: the Explore, Refine, and Produce Phases. Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.",

Despite the potential insights provided by this technique, its application remains limited to a small number of targeted molecules and pathways. Because previous software tools usually require chemical formulas to find relevant features, and the data are highly complex, especially in untargeted metabolomics and when the downstream reactions and metabolites are poorly characterized. We report here Khipu version 2 and its new user-friendly web application. New functions are added to enhance analyzing stable isotope tracing data including metrics that evaluate peak enrichment in labeled samples, scoring methods to facilitate robust detection of intensity patterns and integrated natural abundance correction.

In recent years several non-linear machine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity but with limited uptake essentially due to convoluted optimisation and interpretation.

However, preserving topological structure among cells to low dimensional space remains a challenge. Here, we present the single-cell graph autoencoder (scGAE), a dimensionality reduction method that preserves topological structure in scRNA-seq data. scGAE builds a cell graph and uses a multitask-oriented graph autoencoder to preserve topological structure information and feature information in scRNA-seq data simultaneously. We further extended scGAE for scRNA-seq data visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. Analyses of simulated data showed that scGAE accurately reconstructs developmental trajectory and separates discrete cell clusters under different scenarios, outperforming recently developed deep learning methods. Furthermore, implementation of scGAE on empirical data showed scGAE provided novel insights into cell developmental lineages and preserved inter-cluster distances.",

However, it may produce a long list of significant terms with highly redundant information that is difficult to summarize. Current tools to simplify enrichment results by clustering them into groups either still produce redundancy between clusters or do not retain consistent term similarities within clusters. We propose a new method named binary cut for clustering similarity matrices of functional terms. Through comprehensive benchmarks on both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that binary cut could efficiently cluster functional terms into groups where terms showed consistent similarities within groups and were mutually exclusive between groups. We compared binary cut clustering on the similarity matrices obtained from different similarity measures and found that semantic similarity worked well with binary cut, while similarity matrices based on gene overlap showed less consistent patterns. We implemented the binary cut algorithm in the R package simplifyEnrichment, which additionally provides functionalities for visualizing, summarizing, and comparing the clustering.

		"abstract": "Understanding the structural and functional diversity of protein families is crucial for elucidating their biological roles. Traditional analyses often focus on primary and secondary structures, which include amino acid sequences and local folding patterns like alpha helices and beta sheets. However, primary and secondary structures alone may not fully represent the complex interactions within proteins. To address this limitation, we developed a new algorithm (InteracTor) to analyze proteins by extracting features from their three-dimensional (3D) structures. The toolkit extracts interatomic interaction features such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic contacts, which are crucial for understanding protein dynamics, structure, and function. Incorporating 3D structural data and interatomic interaction features provides a more comprehensive understanding of protein structure and function, potentially enhancing downstream predictive modeling capabilities. By using the extracted features in Mutual Information scoring (MI), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and hierarchical clustering analysis as use cases, we identified clear separations among protein structural families, highlighting distinct functional aspects. Our analysis revealed that interatomic interaction features were more informative than protein secondary structure features, providing insights into potential structural and functional properties. These findings underscore the significance of considering tertiary structure in protein analysis, offering a robust framework for future studies aiming at enhancing the capabilities of models for protein function prediction and drug discovery.",

		"abstract": "Does the choice of programming language affect energy consumption? Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly. It first corrects and improves the measurement methodology used by prior work. It then develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.",

		"abstract": "Introduction: Thorough maintenance of the scientific record is needed to ensure the trustworthiness of its content. This can be undermined by a stealth correction, which is at least one post-publication change made to a scientific article, without providing a correction note or any other indicator that the publication was temporarily or permanently altered. In this paper we provide several examples of stealth corrections in order to demonstrate that these exist within the scientific literature. As far as we are aware, no documentation of such stealth corrections was previously reported in the scientific literature. Methods: We identified stealth corrections ourselves, or found already reported ones on the public database pubpeer.com or through social media accounts of known science sleuths. Results: In total we report 131 articles that were affected by stealth corrections and were published between 2005 and 2024. These stealth corrections were found among multiple publishers and scientific fields. Conclusion: and recommendations Stealth corrections exist in the scientific literature. This needs to end immediately as it threatens scientific integrity. We recommend the following: 1) Tracking all changes to the published record by all publishers in an open, uniform and transparent manner, preferably by online submission systems that log every change publicly, making stealth corrections impossible; 2) Clear definitions and guidelines on all types of corrections; 3) Support sustained vigilance of the scientific community to publicly register stealth corrections.",

		"abstract": "This planetary boundaries framework update finds that six of the nine boundaries are transgressed, suggesting that Earth is now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity. Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.",

		"abstract": "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.",

		"abstract": "Marginal-likelihood based model-selection, even though promising, is rarely used in deep learning due to estimation difficulties. Instead, most approaches rely on validation data, which may not be readily available. In this work, we present a scalable marginal-likelihood estimation method to select both hyperparameters and network architectures, based on the training data alone. Some hyperparameters can be estimated online during training, simplifying the procedure. Our marginal-likelihood estimate is based on Laplace's method and Gauss-Newton approximations to the Hessian, and it outperforms cross-validation and manual-tuning on standard regression and image classification datasets, especially in terms of calibration and out-of-distribution detection. Our work shows that marginal likelihoods can improve generalization and be useful when validation data is unavailable (e.g., in nonstationary settings).",

		"abstract": "Objective Reduced Paneth cell (PC) numbers are observed in inflammatory bowel diseases and impaired PC function contributes to the ileal pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD). PCs reside in proximity to Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISC) and mitochondria are critical for ISC-renewal and differentiation. Here, we characterise ISC and PC appearance under inflammatory conditions and describe the role of mitochondrial function for ISC niche-maintenance.\nDesign Ileal tissue samples from patients with CD, mouse models for mitochondrial dysfunction (Hsp60Δ/ΔISC) and CD-like ileitis (TNFΔARE), and intestinal organoids were used to characterise PCs and ISCs in relation to mitochondrial function.\nResults In patients with CD and TNFΔARE mice, inflammation correlated with reduced numbers of Lysozyme-positive granules in PCs and decreased Lgr5 expression in crypt regions. Disease-associated changes in PC and ISC appearance persisted in non-inflamed tissue regions of patients with CD and predicted the risk of disease recurrence after surgical resection. ISC-specific deletion of Hsp60 and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration linked mitochondrial function to the aberrant PC phenotype. Consistent with reduced stemness in vivo, crypts from inflamed TNFΔARE mice fail to grow into organoids ex vivo. Dichloroacetate-mediated inhibition of glycolysis, forcing cells to shift to mitochondrial respiration, improved ISC niche function and rescued the ability of TNFΔARE mice-derived crypts to form organoids.\nConclusion We provide evidence that inflammation-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium triggers a metabolic imbalance, causing reduced stemness and acquisition of a dysfunctional PC phenotype. Blocking glycolysis might be a novel drug target to antagonise PC dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CD.",

Focusing on diffuse IDH-mutated low-grade glioma, this study presents a workflow for Spatial Multi-omics Integration, SMINT, specifically combining spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics. Our workflow incorporates both existing and custom-developed computational tools to enable cell segmentation and registration of spatial coordinates from both modalities to a common coordinate framework. During our investigation of cell segmentation strategies, we found that nuclei-only segmentation, while containing only 40% of segmented cell transcripts, enables accurate cell type annotation, but does not account for multinucleated cells. Our integrative workflow including cell-morphology segmentation identified distinct cellular neighborhoods at the infiltrating edge of gliomas, which were enriched in multinucleated and oligodendrocyte-lineage tumor cells, that may drive tumor invasion into the normal cortical layers of the brain.",

Tumoroids present an avenue for modelling this diversity and replicating the intricate tumor heterogeneity. Spatial transcriptomics preserves the spatial context of gene expression enabling us to study distinct tumor areas and the influence on overall diversity. Our spatial transcriptomics analysis uncovered tumor clusters with distinct genetic profiles that showcase various functional areas in depth and offer valuable understandings into the diversity of ccRCC types. Some of these tumor clusters exhibited activity in genes responsible for protein catabolism and reduced abundance of genes related to mitochondrial respiration processes. We also show isoform expression within tumoroids, in particular glutaminase (GLS) especially with the prevalence of the highly metabolically active GAC isoform that is expressed in regions where mitochondrial gene abundance is lower; whereas the KGA isoform displayed a more focal expression pattern. Combining long-read spatial transcriptomics with organoid models presents a novel strategy for unravelling gene and transcript level complexity.",

		"abstract": "Infections have been associated with the incidence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias, but the mechanisms responsible for these associations remain unclear. Using a multicohort approach, we found that influenza, viral, respiratory, and skin and subcutaneous infections were associated with increased long-term dementia risk. These infections were also associated with region-specific brain volume loss, most commonly in the temporal lobe. We identified 260 out of 942 immunologically relevant proteins in plasma that were differentially expressed in individuals with an infection history. Of the infection-related proteins, 35 predicted volumetric changes in brain regions vulnerable to infection-specific atrophy. Several of these proteins, including PIK3CG, PACSIN2, and PRKCB, were related to cognitive decline and plasma biomarkers of dementia (Aβ42/40, GFAP, NfL, pTau-181). Genetic variants that influenced expression of immunologically relevant infection-related proteins, including ITGB6 and TLR5, predicted brain volume loss. Our findings support the role of infections in dementia risk and identify molecular mediators by which infections may contribute to neurodegeneration.",

		"abstract": "When incorporating programming into a statistics course, there are many pedagogical considerations. In R, one consideration is the particular R syntax used. This article reports on a head-to-head comparison of a pair of introductory statistics labs, one conducted in the formula syntax, the other in tidyverse. Pre- and post-surveys show minimal differences between labs, with students reporting a positive experience regardless of section. Analysis of YouTube and RStudio Cloud data shows interesting distinctions. The formula section appeared to watch a larger proportion of pre-lab videos, but spend less time computing. Conversely, the tidyverse section watched a smaller proportion of videos and spent more time computing. The tidyverse labs were slightly longer in terms of lines of code and minutes of videos. The tidyverse labs exposed students to more distinct R functions, but reused functions more frequently. Both labs relied on a relatively small vocabulary of functions, which can provide a starting point for instructors interested in teaching introductory statistics in R. The instructor experience of teaching the two syntaxes diverged when discussing relationships between categorical variables, as well as working with numeric variable summary statistics. This work provides additional evidence for instructors looking to choose between syntaxes for introductory statistics.",

		"abstract": "Over-representation analysis (ORA) is used widely to assess the enrichment of functional categories in a gene list compared to a background list. ORA is therefore a critical method in the interpretation of ’omics data, relating gene lists to biological functions and themes. Although ORA is hugely popular, we and others have noticed two potentially undesired behaviours of some ORA tools. The first one we call the “background problem,” because it involves the software eliminating large numbers of genes from the background list if they are not annotated as belonging to any category. The second one we call the “false discovery rate problem,” because some tools underestimate the true number of parallel tests conducted. Here we demonstrate the impact of these issues on several real RNA-seq datasets and use simulated RNA-seq data to quantify the impact of these problems. We show that the severity of these problems depends on the gene set library, the number of genes in the list, and the degree of noise in the dataset. These problems can be mitigated by changing packages/websites for ORA or by changing to another approach such as functional class scoring.",

		"abstract": "The advent of high-throughput techniques has greatly enhanced biological discovery. Last years, analysis of multi-omics data has taken the front seat to improve physiological understanding. Handling functional enrichment results from various biological data raises practical questions.\nWe propose an integrative workflow to better interpret biological process insights in a multi-omics approach applied to breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) related to Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) and Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC). Pathway enrichment by Over Representation Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) has been conducted with both features information from differential expression analysis or selected features from multi-block sPLS-DA methods. Then, comprehensive comparisons of enrichment results have been carried out by looking at classical enrichment analysis, probabilities pooling by Stouffer’s Z scores method and pathways clustering in biological themes.\nOur work shows that ORA enrichment with selected sPLS-DA features and pathways probabilities pooling by Stouffer’s method lead to enrichment maps highly associated to physiological knowledge of IDC or ILC phenotypes, better than ORA and GSEA with differential expression driven features.",

		"abstract": "Multi-omics data are good resources for prognosis and survival prediction; however, these are difficult to integrate computationally. We introduce DeepProg, a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. It identifies two optimal survival subtypes in most cancers and yields significantly better risk-stratification than other multi-omics integration methods. DeepProg is highly predictive, exemplified by two liver cancer (C-index 0.73–0.80) and five breast cancer datasets (C-index 0.68–0.73). Pan-cancer analysis associates common genomic signatures in poor survival subtypes with extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes.

		"abstract": "Technologies to measure whole-genome mRNA abundances1,2,3 and methods to organize and display such data4,5,6,7,8,9,10 are emerging as valuable tools for systems-level exploration of transcriptional regulatory networks. For instance, it has been shown that mRNA data from 118 genes, measured at several time points in the developing hindbrain of mice, can be hierarchically clustered into various patterns (or 'waves') whose members tend to participate in common processes5. We have previously shown that hierarchical clustering can group together genes whose cis-regulatory elements are bound by the same proteins in vivo6. Hierarchical clustering has also been used to organize genes into hierarchical dendograms on the basis of their expression across multiple growth conditions7. The application of Fourier analysis to synchronized yeast mRNA expression data has identified cell-cycle periodic genes, many of which have expected  cis-regulatory elements8. Here we apply a systematic set of statistical algorithms, based on whole-genome mRNA data, partitional clustering and motif discovery, to identify transcriptional regulatory sub-networks in yeast—without any a priori knowledge of their structure or any assumptions about their dynamics. This approach uncovered new regulons (sets of co-regulated genes) and their putative cis-regulatory elements. We used statistical characterization of known regulons and motifs to derive criteria by which we infer the biological significance of newly discovered regulons and motifs. Our approach holds promise for the rapid elucidation of genetic network architecture in sequenced organisms in which little biology is known.",

		"abstract": "There is increasing evidence that changes in the variability or overall distribution of gene expression are important both in normal biology and in diseases, particularly cancer. Genes whose expression differs in variability or distribution without a difference in mean are ignored by traditional differential expression-based analyses. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model that provides tests for both differential variability and differential distribution for bulk RNA-seq data, we report here an investigation into differential variability and distribution in cancer. Analysis of eight paired tumour–normal datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas confirms that differential variability and distribution analyses are able to identify cancer-related genes. We further demonstrate that differential variability identifies cancer-related genes that are missed by differential expression analysis, and that differential expression and differential variability identify functionally distinct sets of potentially cancer-related genes. These results suggest that differential variability analysis may provide insights into genetic aspects of cancer that would not be revealed by differential expression, and that differential distribution analysis may allow for more comprehensive identification of cancer-related genes than analyses based on changes in mean or variability alone.",

		"abstract": "Women and girls are underrepresented in many, though not all, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields around the world. In this Review, we describe four key factors that help explain the continued underrepresentation of women in STEM. In many parts of the world, women lack access to education and job opportunities, preventing them from pursuing STEM. In places where women do have educational and professional opportunities, masculine cultures — shaped by both masculine defaults and differential treatment — can hinder entry and retention of women in STEM fields. Addressing masculine cultures is important to increase the representation of women, and research has identified multiple promising avenues for intervention. When masculine cultures remain, gender disparities can be reduced by increasing the positive experiences of women and girls in STEM. Finally, choices made by men to enter some STEM fields also contribute to the underrepresentation of women in these fields. We conclude by reviewing promising future directions for research on gender disparities in STEM, including examining the intersections of these factors, sociopolitical and economic contexts, and the experiences of trans and non-binary individuals and people with multiple marginalized identities in STEM.",

		"abstract": "Many human genes, including transcription factor (TF) genes, produce alternative coding isoforms. Although some alternative coding TF isoforms have been experimentally studied, a genome-wide characterisation of all such isoforms in normal human physiology is still lacking. Here, we integrate RNA sequencing and protein domain data to reveal the expression levels, tissue specificity and putative functional classes of alternative coding isoforms of human TF genes. We found that isoforms lacking a DNA-binding domain (DBD) are annotated for almost a third of known TF genes, comprise 17% of all annotated TF isoforms and likely reverse the regulatory effects of DBD-containing isoforms. Considering all coding TF isoforms, we uncovered 536 switches between the highest-expressed alternative isoforms produced by 360 TF genes across 43 adult tissues. We predicted functional consequences of these switches using a functional annotation of structural domains present in switching isoforms. Furthermore, we found 45 isoform switches between the brain and non-brain tissues and interpreted six of these switches in detail. Finally, we assembled a literature-based compendium of human TF genes with experimentally studied alternative isoforms. In total, our results suggest that the switches of alternative coding TF isoforms between adult tissues represent a widespread, yet understudied, functional mechanism.",

		"abstract": "Background and Objectives\nMigraine is linked to higher risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, but it is uncertain whether this risk is due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. This study aimed to examine the cardiovascular risks associated with migraine during time with and without NSAID use.\nMethods\nWe conducted a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study of individuals with a first-time hospital diagnosis of migraine (hospital-diagnosed) or at least 2 prescription fillings for migraine medication (primary care-diagnosed) between 1995 and 2021. We included comparison cohorts matched by birth year and sex from the general population. Exclusion criteria included previous migraine diagnosis, at least 2 prescription fillings for migraine medication, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. We used the Aalen-Johansen estimator to calculate absolute risks and Cox regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the association between migraine and the outcomes.\nResults\nThe study included 46,647 individuals with hospital-diagnosed migraine and 186,588 matched comparisons and 288,529 individuals with primary care–diagnosed migraine and 1,154,116 matched comparisons. Those with hospital-diagnosed migraine had higher 20-year risks of myocardial infarction (3.3% vs 2.2%; aHR 1.53; 95% CI 1.40–1.67) and ischemic stroke (4.5% vs 2.4%; aHR 1.94; 95% CI 1.80–2.10) than comparisons. These increased risks were comparable during time with and without NSAID use for myocardial infarction. For ischemic stroke, the point estimate remained increased during time with and without NSAID use, although it seemed higher during time without NSAID use (aHR 1.97; 95% CI 1.82–2.13) than with NSAID use (aHR 1.49; 95% CI 1.13–1.97). Individuals with primary care–diagnosed migraine overall did not have higher risks of the outcomes than comparisons, regardless of NSAID use.\nDiscussion\nThe increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke associated with hospital-diagnosed migraine could not be explained by NSAID-associated cardiovascular risks.\nClassification of Evidence\nThis study provides Class III evidence that NSAID-associated cardiovascular risks cannot explain the association between migraine and myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke.",

		"abstract": "The corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the resulting long-term neurological complications in patients, known as long COVID, have renewed interest in the correlation between viral infections and neurodegenerative brain disorders. While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as APLP1 (amyloid β precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, α2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin, and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Additionally, viral amyloid induction led to a dramatic drop in the soluble protein concentration in the CSF. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF and result in soluble protein depletion, thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.",

		"abstract": "Drug-drug synergy (DDS) is crucial for identifying novel and effective drug combinations. With the accumulation of experimental data (DrugCombDB) and the uprising of deep learning approaches, many efforts have been made to computationally predict effective drug pairs. However, most models had limited success, with the highest ROC AUC of 0.65 for predicting pairs of unseen drugs. Drug-induced gene expressions profiles (DGEP) from datasets like LINCS L1000 offer a robust proxy to describe drug effects. However, overlap between DrugCombDB and experimental DGEP data is sparse only ~2%. To address these limitations, we propose the DRUGSYNC (Drug Response and Utilization for Graph-based SYNergy Classification) prediction framework that leverages pre-learned drug-target interaction (DTI) and pre-learned DGEP as features. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was used to represent the inherent network of genetic interactions. Our pre-learned DGEP achieved 0.877 Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). Furthermore, our framework excels by integrating pre-learned DGEP and DTI of paired drugs for DDS prediction, achieving superior performance over benchmark technologies. Notably, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting interactions between unseen drugs, with an ROC AUC score of 0.854. The analysis further emphasized the importance of accurate DGEP predictions. This method can be extended to any cell lines.",

We introduce CorrAdjust, a method for identifying and correcting such hidden confounders. CorrAdjust selects a subset of principal components to residualize from expression data by maximizing the enrichment of “reference pairs” among highly correlated RNA-RNA pairs. Unlike traditional machine learning metrics, this novel enrichment-based metric is specifically designed to evaluate correlation data and provides valuable RNA-level interpretability. CorrAdjust outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on 25,063 human RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, and the Geuvadis collection. In particular, CorrAdjust excels at integrating small RNA and mRNA sequencing data, significantly enhancing the enrichment of experimentally validated miRNA targets among negatively correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs. CorrAdjust, with accompanying documentation and tutorials, is available through GitHub at https://tju-cmc-org.github.io/CorrAdjust.",

		"abstract": "Data science is an emerging field that provides new analytical methods. It incorporates novel data sources (eg, internet data) and methods (eg, machine learning) that offer valuable and timely insights into public health issues, including injury and violence prevention. The objective of this research was to describe ethical considerations for public health data scientists conducting injury and violence prevention–related data science projects to prevent unintended ethical, legal, and social consequences, such as loss of privacy or loss of public trust. We first reviewed foundational bioethics and public health ethics literature to identify key ethical concepts relevant to public health data science. After identifying these ethics concepts, we held a series of discussions to organize them under broad ethical domains. Within each domain, we examined relevant ethics concepts from our review of the primary literature. Lastly, we developed questions for each ethical domain to facilitate the early conceptualization stage of the ethical analysis of injury and violence prevention projects. We identified 4 ethical domains: privacy, responsible stewardship, justice as fairness, and inclusivity and engagement. We determined that each domain carries equal weight, with no consideration bearing more importance than the others. Examples of ethical considerations are clearly identifying project goals, determining whether people included in projects are at risk of reidentification through external sources or linkages, and evaluating and minimizing the potential for bias in data sources used. As data science methodologies are incorporated into public health research to work toward reducing the effect of injury and violence on individuals, families, and communities in the United States, we recommend that relevant ethical issues be identified, considered, and addressed.",

		"abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is indispensable for processing high-throughput omics datasets, as it can extract meaningful biological variability while minimizing the influence of noise. However, the suitability of PCA is contingent on appropriate normalization and transformation of count data, and accurate selection of the number of principal components; improper choices can result in the loss of biological information or corruption of the signal due to excessive noise. Typical approaches to these challenges rely on heuristics that lack theoretical foundations. In this work, we present Biwhitened PCA (BiPCA), a theoretically grounded framework for rank estimation and data denoising across a wide range of omics modalities. BiPCA overcomes a fundamental difficulty with handling count noise in omics data by adaptively rescaling the rows and columns – a rigorous procedure that standardizes the noise variances across both dimensions. Through simulations and analysis of over 100 datasets spanning seven omics modalities, we demonstrate that BiPCA reliably recovers the data rank and enhances the biological interpretability of count data. In particular, BiPCA enhances marker gene expression, preserves cell neighborhoods, and mitigates batch effects. Our results establish BiPCA as a robust and versatile framework for high-throughput count data analysis.",

		"abstract": "Motivation Genomic studies very often rely on computational intensive analyses of relationships between features, which are typically represented as intervals along one-dimensional coordinate system (such as positions on a chromosome). In this context, Python programming language is extensively used for manipulation and analysis of data stored in a tabular-form of rows and columns called dataframe. Pandas is the most-widely used Python dataframe package and is criticized for its inefficiencies and scalability problems that its novel alternative – Polars – tries to address with a vectorized backend written in Rust programming language.\nResults polars-bio is a Python library that enables fast, parallel and out-of-core operations on large genomic intervals datasets. Its main components are implemented in Rust, using the Apache DataFusion query engine and Apache Arrow for efficient data representation. It is compatible with Polars and Pandas DataFrame formats. Single-thread benchmarking results confirm that for operations such as count overlaps is 38x and coverage is 15x faster than the state-of-the-art bioframe library. Our implementation of overlap operation consumes 90x less memory in streaming mode. Multi-thread benchmarks show good scalability and up to 282x speedup for count overlaps operation when executed with 8 CPU cores. To the best of our knowledge, polars-bio is the fastest single-node library for genomic interval dataframes in Python.\nAvailability and implementation polars-bio is an open source Python package distributed under the Apache License available for all main platforms, such as Linux, macOS and Windows in the PyPI registry.

		"abstract": "Insulin resistance is a condition associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes(T2D), hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and defined by reduced sensitivity to insulin signaling. Molecular causes and early signaling events underlying insulin resistance are not well understood. Here we show that insulin activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in insulin target tissues, causes mTORC1 induction of PTEN translation, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. We hypothesized that insulin resistance is due to insulin dependent induction of PTEN that prevents further increases in PI3K signaling. In a diet induced animal model of obesity and insulin resistance, we show that PTEN levels are increased in fat, muscle, and liver. Hyperinsulinemia and PTEN induction are followed by hyperglycemia, severe glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. In response to chronic hyperinsulinemia, PTEN remains increased, while AKT activity is induced transiently before settling down to a PTEN-high and AKT-low state in the tissues, predicted by computational modeling of the PTEN-AKT feedback loop. Treatment with PTEN and mTORC1 inhibitors prevent and reverse the effect of PTEN induction, rescue insulin resistance and increase PI3K/AKT signaling. Thus, we show that PTEN induction by increased insulin levels elevates feedback inhibition of the pathway causing insulin resistance, its associated phenotypes, and is a potential therapeutic target.",

		"abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is indispensable for processing high-throughput omics datasets, as it can extract meaningful biological variability while minimizing the influence of noise. However, the suitability of PCA is contingent on appropriate normalization and transformation of count data, and accurate selection of the number of principal components; improper choices can result in the loss of biological information or corruption of the signal due to excessive noise. Typical approaches to these challenges rely on heuristics that lack theoretical foundations. In this work, we present Biwhitened PCA (BiPCA), a theoretically grounded framework for rank estimation and data denoising across a wide range of omics modalities. BiPCA overcomes a fundamental difficulty with handling count noise in omics data by adaptively rescaling the rows and columns – a rigorous procedure that standardizes the noise variances across both dimensions. Through simulations and analysis of over 100 datasets spanning seven omics modalities, we demonstrate that BiPCA reliably recovers the data rank and enhances the biological interpretability of count data. In particular, BiPCA enhances marker gene expression, preserves cell neighborhoods, and mitigates batch effects. Our results establish BiPCA as a robust and versatile framework for high-throughput count data analysis.",

Although many life sciences majors are interested in learning how to code, they are nervous to learn and have not been warmly invited into computational fields. While there is much research on entry into computer science broadly, there is limited research on the unique barriers facing life sciences majors as they are introduced to programming. To address this gap, we sought to understand students' motivations to take a new introductory coding class in biology. We conducted focus group interviews with 22 students that revealed a range of motivations for taking the course, ranging from social and career motivation to the ability to be creative or analyze biological datasets. In addition, we probed the expectations for students taking the course, finding a wide range that varied depending on students' progression through college and prior experiences of pursuing opportunities to learn programming skills. Our findings elucidate the reasons students choose to take a discipline-based programming class and have implications of practices for inviting these students into these spaces.",

		"abstract": "Summary We developed xOmicsShiny, a feature-rich R Shiny-powered application that enables biologists to fully explore omics datasets across experiments and data types, with an emphasis on uncovering biological insights at the pathway level. The data merging feature ensures flexible exploration of cross-omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. The pathway mapping function covers a broad range of databases, including WikiPathways, Reactome, and KEGG pathways. In addition, xOmicsShiny offers several visualization options and analytical tasks for everyday omics data analysis, namely, PCA, Volcano plot, Venn Diagram, Heatmap, WGCNA, and advanced clustering analyses. The application employs customizable modules to perform various tasks, generating both interactive plots and publication-ready figures. This dynamic, modular design overcomes the issue of slow loading in R Shiny tools and allows it to be readily expanded by the research and developer community.\nAvailability and implementation The R Shiny application is publicly available at: http://xOmicsShiny.bxgenomics.com. Researchers can upload their own data to the server or use the pre-loaded demo dataset.

		"abstract": "Background: As technologies for genome-wide gene-expression analysis continue to develop, the databases storing the resulting data have grown accordingly. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has grown to over 250,000 data series across more than 25,000 omics platforms. Likewise, ArrayExpress is comprised of over 70,000 transcriptome and methylome datasets. Conducting meta-analyses of data from these databases can be challenging, typically requiring extensive manual grouping of samples to identify experimental groups for comparison. Results: Here we present sampleclusteR, a lightweight R package which automates the clustering of gene-expression study samples based on their metadata. To demonstrate the utility of the approach to large scale analysis of GEO data series, 275 GEO data series were analysed using the package. sampleclusteR was able to correctly cluster 4694 of the 5081 samples across the 275 data sets in an unsupervised manner. In addition, 250 datasets from ArrayExpress were analysed by the package with 8547 of the 9154 samples being automatically clustered into correct groups. We show how sampleclusteR can be used to automate analysis of gene-expression datasets by conducting a meta-analysis of multiple GEO data series related to the Wnt signaling pathway. sampleclusteR correctly assigned all samples to the correct experimental groups and identified sets of differentially expressed genes for downstream analysis. Conclusions: sampleclusteR enables large-scale analysis of data from GEO or ArrayExpress by automating the clustering of both GEO and ArrayExpress metadata tables using text mining of their associated metadata.",

Here we report an approach to isolate one component of the long-sought astrocyte-derived toxic factor5,6. Notably, instead of a protein, saturated lipids contained in APOE and APOJ lipoparticles mediate astrocyte-induced toxicity. Eliminating the formation of long-chain saturated lipids by astrocyte-specific knockout of the saturated lipid synthesis enzyme ELOVL1 mitigates astrocyte-mediated toxicity in vitro as well as in a model of acute axonal injury in vivo. These results suggest a mechanism by which astrocytes kill cells in the central nervous system.",

At high concentrations, they are risk factors for food intoxication, whereas moderate levels may lead to food intolerance. Sensitive persons, with insufficient diamine oxidase activity, suffer from numerous undesirable reactions after intake of histamine containing foods. Besides spoiled foodstuffs, especially fermented foods tend to contain elevated levels of biogenic amines, although their concentrations vary extensively not only between different food varieties but also within the varieties themselves. High histamine content in foods and beverages result from microbial contamination. The evidence of enteral histaminosis represents a challenge for the food industry to produce foods with histamine levels as low as possible. We therefore investigated critical steps for histamine formation during food production processes, and established production methods that include low-histamine technology.",

		"abstract": "With the growing number of metabolomics and lipidomics studies, robust strategies for bioinformatic analyses are increasingly important. However, the absence of standardized and reproducible workflows, coupled with ambiguous metabolite annotations, hampers effective analysis, particularly when integrating prior knowledge with metabolomics data. Moreover, the limited availability of comprehensive, curated prior knowledge further limits functional analyses and reduces the extraction of meaningful biological insights. Here we present MetaProViz (Metabolomics Processing, functional analysis and Visualization), a free open-source R package for metabolomics data analysis that integrates prior knowledge to generate mechanistic hypotheses (https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/). MetaProViz offers a flexible framework consisting of five modules: processing, differential analysis, prior knowledge integration, functional analysis and visualisation, applicable to both intracellular and exometabolomics experiments. To improve functional analysis, we created the Metabolism Signature Database (MetSigDB), a collection of annotated metabolite sets. MetSigDB includes classical pathway-metabolite sets, metabolite-receptor and metabolite-transporter sets, and chemical class-metabolite sets. In addition, MetaProViz enables the conversion of gene sets to metabolite sets by using enzyme-metabolic reaction associations. In addition, MetaProViz translates between metabolite identifiers of commonly used databases, analyzes mapping ambiguities and completes missing annotations. The MetaProViz functional analysis toolkit includes sample metadata analysis, classical enrichment analysis and biologically informed clustering. We showcase MetaProViz functionalities using kidney cancer metabolomics data from cell lines, cell-culture media, and tumour tissue. We found increased methionine usage in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines in line with decreased methionine levels in tumour samples. Further, we link this observation to enzymes and transporters crucial for overall survival in ccRCC and suggest that the increased methionine usage reflects the elevated DNA-hypermethylation landscape, a known characteristic in ccRCC. In summary, MetaProViz facilitates and improves the analysis and interpretation of metabolomics data.",

Here, in this cross-sectional study, we used the Olink Explore 3072 platform to investigate plasma proteomics as a biomarker tool for this neurodegenerative condition. Thirty-three proteins were differentially abundant in the plasma of patients with ALS (\n              n\n               = 183) versus controls (\n              n\n               = 309). We replicated our findings in an independent cohort (\n              n\n               = 48 patients with ALS and\n              n\n               = 75 controls). We then applied machine learning to create a model that diagnosed ALS with high accuracy (area under the curve, 98.3%). By analyzing plasma samples from individuals before ALS symptoms emerged, we estimated the age of clinical onset and showed that the disease process—impacting skeletal muscle, nerves and energy metabolism—occurs years before symptoms appear. Our research suggests that plasma proteins can be a biomarker for this fatal disease and offers molecular insights into its prodromal phase.",

		"abstract": "Differential transcript usage (DTU) refers to changes in the relative abundance of transcript isoforms of the same gene between experimental conditions, even when the total expression of the gene doesn’t change. DTU analysis requires the quantification of individual isoforms from RNA-seq data, which has a high level of uncertainty due to transcript overlap and read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA). Popular DTU analysis methods do not directly account for the RTA overdispersion within their statistical frameworks, leading to reduced statistical power or poor error rate control, particularly in scenarios with small sample sizes. This article presents limma and edgeR analysis pipelines that account for RTA during DTU assessment. Leveraging recent advancements in the limma and edgeR Bioconductor packages, we propose DTU analysis pipelines optimized for small and large datasets with a unified interface via the diffSplice function. The pipelines make use of divided counts to remove RTA-induced dispersion from transcript isoform counts and account for the sparsity in transcript-level counts. Simulations and analysis of real data from mouse mammary epithelial cells demonstrate that the diffSplice pipelines provide greater power, improved efficiency, and improved FDR control compared to existing specialized DTU methods.",

		"abstract": "Summary A big challenge to integrating public metabolic resources is the use of different nomenclatures by individual databases. This paper presents md_harmonize, an open-source Python package for harmonizing compounds and metabolic reactions across various metabolic databases. md_harmonize utilizes a neighborhood-specific graph coloring method for generating a unique identifier for each compound via atom identifiers based on the compound structure. The resulting harmonized compounds and reactions can be used to construct metabolic networks and models for various downstream analyses, including metabolic flux analysis.\nAvailability The md_harmonize package is implemented in Python and freely available at https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/md_harmonize\nContact hunter.moseley{at}uky.edu\nSupplementary information Supplementary data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21699683.",

		"abstract": "limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.",
