# Metabolomics Data are Missing Not At Random

Metabolomics data can contain a large amount of missingness, regardless of whether the metabolites are measured using mass-spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), with examples from metabolomics workbench ranging from 0.01 - 90% missing values for MS and 1 - 26% missing values for NMR experiments, respectively (@fig-ranks (A)).
Using a binomial test for missing not at random (MNAR) due to left-censoring, we find that after adjusting for multiple testing, 235 of 242 experiments have a p-value < 0.05.

Calculating the median rank of metabolites, and the number of missing samples, we can see there is a direct relationship between the number of samples a metabolite is missing from and the minimum value of the median rank (@fig-ranks C & D).
Over all the datasets, the correlation of rank to number of missing is overwhelmingly negative, with a few datasets with positive correlations that we suspect have incorrectly or insufficiently defined subject sample factors (@fig-ranks B).

Number of samples a metabolite is missing in vs the median rank or minimum median rank of the metabolite in the group of samples.

Correlation of both metabolites and samples is frequently undertaken in metabolomics studies for many different purposes, including the generation of metabolite-metabolite interaction networks, and sample-sample pairwise correlations to highlight biological and batch groups, or determine possible outliers prior to subsequent analysis.
However, correlation measures are severely impacted by the presence of missing values.

# Missingness as Useful Information

Given that the missingness is MNAR, and that it seems largely due to left-censoring in analytical instrumentation, we believe that the missingness therefore encodes useful information. 
To make use of this information, we propose the **information-content-informed Kendall-tau** (ICI-Kt) methodology.
Kendall-tau correlation is the easiest correlation to manipulate due to the way it encodes the ranks through pairwise comparisons of the ranks of data points by concordance and discordance of the data points.

* Concordant:  $x_i > x_j \text{and} y_i > y_j \| x_i < x_j \text{and} y_i < y_j$
* Discordant:  $x_i > x_j \text{and} y_i < y_j \| x_i < x_j  \text{and} y_i > y_j$

$$\tau_b = \frac{n_{concordant} - n_{discordant}}{\sqrt{(n_{tot} - n_{xtie})(n_{tot} - n_{ytie})}}$$

where $n_{tot}$ is the total number of pairs, $n_{xtie}$ are the number of tied values in X, and $n_{ytie}$ are the number of paired values in Y. 
When we consider that most missingness is due to left-censorship, we can add to the definitions of concordant and discordant pairs that incorporate missingness, treating it as a *low* value.

* Concordant: $x_i > x_j \text{and} y_i \text{&} !y_j \| x_i < x_j \text{and} !y_i \text{&} y_j \| x_i \text{&} !x_j \text{and} y_i > y_j \| !x_i \text{&} x_j \text{and} y_i < y_j \| x_i \text{&} !x_j \text{and} y_i \text{&} !y_j \| !x_i \text{&} x_j \text{and} !y_i \text{&} y_j$ 
* Discordant: $x_i > x_j \text{and} y_i < y_j \| x_i < x_j \text{and} y_i > y_j \| x_i > x_j \text{and} !y_i \text{&} y_j \| x_i < x_j \text{and} y_i \text{&} !y_j \| x_i \text{&} !x_j \text{and} y_i < y_j \| !x_i \text{&} x_j \text{and} y_i > y_j \| x_i \text{&} !x_j \text{and} !y_i \text{&} y_j || !x_i \text{&} x_j \text{and} y_i \text{&} !y_j$

# MNAR vs MAR

![Effect of introducing missing values from a cutoff (**A** & **B**) or randomly (**C**) on different measures of correlation, including ICI-Kt, Kendall with pairwise complete, Kendall replacing missing with 0, Pearson with pairwise complete, and Pearson replacing missing with 0. **A**: Missing values introduced by setting an increasing cutoff. **B**: Missing values introduced by setting an increasing cutoff, and then log-transforming the values before calculating correlation. **C**: Missing values introduced at random. For the random case, each sample of random positions was repeated 100 times. Pay attention to the different y-axis ranges across graphs, with **A** and **B** graphs having much smaller y-axis ranges compared to **C**.](./images/censored_value_plot.png)

# Removing Outlier Samples

# Methods

## Data

**Repaired** Metabolomics Workbench (MW) analysis files were obtained for a large sample of the analyses available from MW.
For each analysis, we parsed the various data blocks to generate R compatible data.
For this work, we only kept analyses that had:

1. 200 or more metabolites measured;
1. Two or more subject sample factors with 4 or more replicates;
1. Contained missing values (parsing to numeric returned NA or 0);
1. Abundance data could be directly parsed to a matrix (some were lists ...);
1. Only one species was measured;
1. The sample IDs between subject sample factors and the metabolites data matched.

This resulted in 241 analyses, to which we added a previously published MS direct injection lipidomics dataset, for a total of 242.

Prior to calculations, all metabolite values <= 0 were set to R's missing indicator, `NA`, so that zeros and actually missing indicated values were treated identically, and missingness could be replaced with zero for some correlation calculations.

## Correlation Methods

For each dataset, we calculated correlations using a variety of methods. In each dataset, there were either zero values or `NA` values to represent missingness.
To start, we replaced all zero values with `NA`, and then either left them as `NA` or changed them to zero as appropriate.

* ICI-Kendall-tau using `NA` (icikt); 
* and then scaled (multiplied) by a completeness metric (icikt_completeness);
* Kendall-tau using `NA`, and then using pairwise-complete-observations (kt);
* Pearson, with zeros replacing `NA`, using pairwise-complete-observations (pearson_base);
* Pearson, using `NA` and pairwise-complete-observations (pearson_no_zero).
* Pearson, with zeros replacing `NA`, and then a $log(x + 1)$ transform applied, using pairwise-complete-observations (pearson_log1p).
* Pearson, with zeros replacing `NA`, and then a $log(x)$ transform, and setting infinite values to `NA` values, using pairwise-complete-observations (PL).

## Detecting and Removing Possible Outliers

For outlier detection, median sample-sample correlations within the sample treatment (genotype, condition, etc) is calculated, and $log(1 - cor_{median})$ calculated to transform it into a score. Then outliers are determined using *grDevices::boxplot.stats*, which by default are at 1.5X the whiskers in a box-and-whisker plot.
As we are interested in only those correlations at the *low* end of correlation (becoming the high end after the subtraction and log-transform), we restrict to only those entries at the *high* end of the score distribution (using *visualizationQualityControl::determine_outliers* [@flightVisualizationQualityControlDevelopmentVisualization2021]).
This is equivalent to using the correlation component of the score described by Gierliński et al [-@gierlinski_statisticalmodels_2015] and setting the other component weights to zero.
